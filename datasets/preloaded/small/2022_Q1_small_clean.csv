0,LYB,1,2022,2022-04-29 13:03:15,"Hello, and welcome to the LyondellBasell teleconference. At the request of LyondellBasell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. . I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Thank you, Alex. Before we begin the discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com/investorrelations.  Today, we will be discussing our business results while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risk and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that could lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our regulatory filings, which are also available at our Investor Relations website.  Additional documents on our Investor website provide reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with other disclosures, including the earnings release and our business results discussion.  A recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1 p.m. Eastern Time today until May 29 by calling 877-660-6853 in the United States and 201-612-7415 outside the United States. The access code for both numbers is 13727006.  During today's call, we will focus on first quarter results, the current market and our near-term outlook.  Before turning the call over to Ken, I would like to call your attention to the noncash lower of cost or market inventory adjustments, or LCM, in the impairments that we have discussed on past calls. LCM adjustments are related to our use of last in, first out or LIFO accounting and the volatility in prices for our raw materials and finished goods inventories. Impairment charges were recognized to write down assets to their estimated fair value. Impairments include the noncash impairment of $624 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 that reflects our evaluation of strategic options for the Houston refinery.  Comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of impairments and LCM inventory adjustments.  With that being said, I now would like to turn the call over to Ken. Thank you, Dave, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our first quarter 2022 results. Today's teleconference marks my second earnings call as the interim CEO of LyondellBasell. And I would like to thank our Board of Directors for the opportunity to lead the company over the past few months. Our incoming CEO, Peter Vanacker, joined our Board on February 25, and we're looking forward to him assuming his role as Chief Executive Officer on May 23. Peter and I have been talking over the past several months to ensure a smooth transition and a successful start to his leadership of our company. I know that Peter is very eager to engage with our employees, customers, investors and suppliers to help us build upon the momentum we have underway in LyondellBasell.  Before we get into the results, I would like to take a moment to address the tragic and unprovoked attacks unfolding in Ukraine. My heart breaks seeing so many people devastated and the resulting humanitarian crisis. At LyondellBasell, we are working to address the impacts of this crisis through our global corporate citizenship program, Advancing Good. The company and our employees have collectively donated more than $600,000 to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Medical Corp.  LyondellBasell's presence in Russia and Ukraine is fairly limited. Less than 0.3% of our 2021 revenue came from Russia and a negligible amount from Ukraine. In March, we announced that LyondellBasell will not enter into any new business transactions or relationships with Russian state-owned entities. We also intend to discontinue business relationships with those companies to the extent legally possible.  Of course, we are also complying with all U.S. and international sanctions. While we have no manufacturing sites in Russia or Ukraine, we do have about 30 employees working in offices in Russia. Last week, we made the difficult decision to cease operations at our Moscow and Togliati offices. We have a local team in place to support our employees during this transition period.  At LyondellBasell, we believe in the power of many, and we hope many of you find ways to support the Ukrainian people and influence peace and stability across Europe.  Now let's review our first quarter results, starting with Slide 3. LyondellBasell's businesses are continuing to benefit from solid global demand and improving markets for products from our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. During the first quarter, LyondellBasell generated $4 per share of earnings, $2 billion of EBITDA and $1.5 billion of cash from operating activities.  The start of the year is typically a seasonally slow period for the petrochemical industry. 2022 marks the first time since 2015 where LyondellBasell earned $2 billion of EBITDA during the first quarter, and our income of $4 per share establishes a new first quarter earnings per share record for the company. Despite a turbulent backdrop of geopolitical uncertainties, ongoing supply chain challenges, and volatile prices for energy and feedstocks, LyondellBasell is off to a great start in 2022.  Let's turn to Slide 4 and review our safety performance. LyondellBasell's commitment to safety leadership remains a consistent and unwavering component of our company's culture. In 2022, our year-to-date total recordable incident rate for employees and contractors has improved by more than 40% to 0.12. This year, we are emphasizing the importance of instilling safety-related touch points during interactions that occur naturally throughout the workday at our facilities. Whether it's planned or spontaneous, these daily touch points provide powerful opportunities to convey authentic and impactful leadership related to safety performance. This personalized approach to safety improvement is yielding results.  During March, we had only 1 recordable injury across our global workforce of more than 19,000 employees. This represents substantial progress toward our ultimate goal of 0 injuries, and I want to thank all of our employees for their commitment to our Goal Zero journey.  On Slide 5, we highlight the recent publication of the fifth edition of our annual sustainability report. This year's report updates our progress to our goals that help in addressing climate change, ending plastic waste and supporting a thriving society.  The cover graphic from the report highlights our focus on 2030 interim targets that track our progress toward longer-term goals. Last September, we accelerated these targets and set a goal to achieve net zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions from our global operations by 2050. Our interim 2030 target is to reduce absolute emissions from our global operations by 30% relative to a 2020 baseline. In the area of circular plastics, our 2030 goal is to produce a meaningful share of our polymer production, 2 million tons per year from recycled and renewable based feedstocks.  And this year, we announced new targets supporting our diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Our goals are to achieve gender parity across our global senior leadership and increase the number of underrepresented groups in our U.S. senior leadership to reflect the general population within 10 years.  Please turn to Slide 6, where we highlight some of our recent collaborations to develop more sustainable products. First, we've collaborated with Nippon Paint to produce packaging for the Chinese market using LyondellBasell's mechanically recycled CirculenRecover polypropylene. The paint containers reuse post-consumer plastic waste and reduce reliance on fossil-based feedstocks.  Next, we show an example of the polyethylene tubes that we developed with our customer, Albea for L'Occitane shower scrub. The caps and tubes are designed to be fully recyclable and made with LyondellBasell's CirculenRevive polymers that are produced from an advanced molecular recycling process using plastic waste. The redesigned tubes retain the iconic brand's look and feel while providing a new life for plastic waste and reducing consumption of fossil-based feedstocks.  Finally, we collaborated with several customers to develop clear polypropylene drink cups for McDonald's from our CirculenRenew polymers using renewable feedstocks produced by Neste from bio-based sources such as McDonald's used cooking oil. We also have a similar collaboration underway with CirculenRevive to make cups for Wendy's restaurants. Wendy's estimates that their couple will divert 10 million pounds of plastic waste from landfills over the first 2 years.  LyondellBasell's collaborations on sustainability extend both up and down the supply chain. In Houston, we helped form the Houston recycling collaboration to increase recycling rates and improve the availability of feedstock from plastic waste. And through our investment with closed loop partners, we have invested in material recovery facilities that support post-consumer plastic waste recycling in New York, New Jersey and Florida.  Also, we are making good progress in decarbonizing our electrical power consumption by eliminating coal at our Wesseling, Germany facility and establishing renewable power purchase agreements with partners.  In addition, we are collaborating with several peers on the development of large-scale carbon capture and storage facilities for the Houston region that would help decarbonize our industry.  Notably, we want to acknowledge our decision to exit the refining business by the end of 2023. This was a difficult decision, but we determined that an exit is likely to provide the best outcome for the company. We will talk more about this decision later in this call. Nonetheless, on the sustainability front, the shutdown of the refinery is expected to reduce LyondellBasell's Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 15%.  Our strategy is to both leverage LyondellBasell's proprietary technology and collaborate with capable partners to advance our progress on circular plastics and decarbonization initiatives.  Please turn to Slide 7 to review our quarterly profitability. During the first quarter, our business portfolio delivered over $2 billion of EBITDA, similar to fourth quarter results. Despite volatile prices for energy and feedstocks, solid product demand supported margins for our products across most markets in Europe and the Americas. Supply disruptions triggered by the war in Ukraine and the COVID pandemic created headwinds during the quarter.  While we remain watchful for signs of demand destruction from inflation, we have been largely successful in passing through higher energy and feedstock costs in the prices of our products.  We expect the strict 0 COVID policies in China will continue to hinder growth and profitability in Asia during the second quarter.  At LyondellBasell, our oxyfuels and refining businesses are benefiting from increased demand for transportation fuels as in-person activities resume and global travel recovers. We expect that favorable markets for transportation fuels will continue through next year.  Slide 8 depicts LyondellBasell's historical profitability. Over the course of the first complete business cycle for our company, we delivered an average of $6.7 billion of EBITDA. In today's strong market and with LyondellBasell's larger asset base, we delivered $9.7 billion of EBITDA over the last 12 months, nearly 45% above the prior cycle average.  LyondellBasell's earnings performance is clearly stepping up from prior business cycles. We are well positioned with a diversified portfolio and larger asset base with propylene oxide and oxyfuels growth underway to extend this performance into the next cycle.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael, who will describe our financial and segment results in more detail. Thank you, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 9, and let me begin by extending the stepping-up theme to the substantial cash generation from our businesses.  In the first quarter, LyondellBasell generated $1.5 billion of cash from operating activities that contributed toward a new record of $8.6 billion in cash from operations over the last 12 months. During the past 4 quarters, our team efficiently converted 88% of our EBITDA into cash. After accounting for sustaining capital reinvested in the business, we achieved a free operating cash flow yield of 23% relative to our market capitalization over the last 12 months.  The LyondellBasell team is highly focused on extending our proven track record of efficient cash generation to provide prudent reinvestment in our company and generous returns for our shareholders.  Let's continue with Slide 10 and review the details of our cash generation and allocation during the first quarter. With $1.5 billion of cash from operating activities, we funded our dividends and capital investments for the first quarter while continuing to repurchase shares and building some cash on the balance sheet. During the first quarter, we returned nearly $600 million to shareholders through our dividend and the repurchase of approximately 2.1 million shares. We continue to invest in maintenance and growth projects with more than $400 million in capital expenditures. This includes our new world-scale PO/TBA plant starting up later this year.  We ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of cash and short-term investments and $5.9 billion of cash and available liquidity. With our total debt at 1.2x trailing EBITDA, our leverage ratios are below our targeted range of 1.5 to 2.5, and we see no need for further deleveraging at this time.  Now I'd like to provide an overview of the results for each of our segments on Slide 11. As Ken mentioned, LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered over $2 billion of EBITDA during the first quarter. Our results reflect solid demand for our products and improving market conditions, benefiting our I&D and APS segments, offset by higher feedstock costs that compressed margins in our O&P-Americas segment.  Let's begin the individual segment discussions on Slide 12 with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment. First quarter 2022 EBITDA was $911 million, $351 million lower than the fourth quarter 2021. Olefin results decreased approximately $170 million compared to the fourth quarter with lower margins due to higher feedstock costs and lower pricing for propylene and butadiene coproducts. We completed planned cracker maintenance at our La Porte, Texas site that contributed to lower volumes and resulted in our North America crackers operating at a rate of 82% during the quarter. Polyolefins results decreased approximately $185 million during the first quarter due to compressed margins driven by lower product prices and higher monomer costs. Stable demand led to relatively comparable volumes despite ongoing logistics and raw material challenges.  In March, we achieved an increase in polyethylene contract prices to reverse fourth quarter trends of declining prices. We continue to see strong demand for our polymers as we head into the second quarter. We expect margin recovery as product prices rise reflect higher energy and feedstock costs and stronger summer demand tightens markets.  Now please turn to Slide 13 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia International segment. Higher product prices and volumes offset rising cost in EAI markets, resulting in first quarter EBITDA of $188 million, $33 million higher than the fourth quarter. Prior quarter results were impacted by LIFO inventory valuation charges of approximately $30 million. Olefins results increased about $25 million as margins improved driven by increased monomer prices that offset higher feedstock and energy cost. We operated our European crackers at a rate of 74% of capacity due to planned maintenance and feedstock supply disruptions resulting from the war in Ukraine. Combined polyolefin results increased approximately $35 million compared to the prior quarter. Stable demand drove increased polyolefin price spreads and volumes despite higher energy and monomer cost. Historically low Asian polyolefin spreads and weaker volumes, driven by COVID-related lockdowns in China caused our joint venture equity income to decline by about $50 million. During the second quarter, we expect that volumes and integrated margins for the segment will be comparable to the first quarter as steady demand should support price increases and keep pace with increasing costs.  On April 13, we reached an agreement to sell our Australian polypropylene business to Veeva Energy. We expect a second quarter noncash asset impairment charge of approximately $70 million in the O&P EAI segment related to the sale of this business.  Last quarter, we provided guidance related to planned maintenance at our cracker in Berre, France. Due to additional work we now think this turnaround will impact second quarter EBITDA by about $50 million. As high inflation begins to trigger concerns about the potential for recession, it is instructive to review the resilience of polyethylene demand growth over the past 30 years.  In Slide 14, the chart depicts the strength of polyethylene demand relative to other markets through the last 4 U.S. recessions. As indicated by the turquoise line, PE demand is remarkably resilient and compounds at a fairly consistent rate of about 4%, meaningfully higher than typical GDP. Unlike U.S. housing and vehicle markets, PE demand is relatively inelastic and embedded in essential products for our modern lives. Polyethylene is a foundational building block for consumer staples with wide-ranging applications such as food packaging, daily hygiene supplies and health care products. And with a cost advantage from shale feedstocks, U.S. polyethylene production increasingly serves a global market. We expect these resilient growth trends will continue as more people in emerging markets gain purchasing power and increased consumption of these essential products for modern life.  Please turn to Slide 15 as we take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Robust margin expansion in most businesses resulted in record first quarter EBITDA of $546 million, $294 million above the prior quarter. Prior quarter results were impacted by LIFO inventory valuation charges of approximately $95 million. First quarter propylene oxide and derivative results increased $50 million as butane dial and other derivative margins expanded. Durable goods demand remained solid, resulting in comparable volumes for the quarter.  Intermediate chemicals results increased more than $30 million. Margins increased in most businesses, primarily styrene and acetyls driven by tight market supply. Volumes increased as a result of improved first quarter operations. Oxyfuels and related products results increased more than $125 million as margins improved on higher gasoline prices and moderation in the ratio of butane feedstock prices relative to crude oil. Prior to the pandemic, our oxyfuels business was a fairly reliable contributor to the profitability of our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. With gasoline demand approaching pre-pandemic levels, we expect a return to typical performance for the oxyfuels business in 2022.  In the second quarter, we expect volumes to increase with seasonal strength in demand for durable goods from building and construction markets. Margins for oxyfuels and related products are expected to expand with typical seasonal reductions in butane feedstock costs and increased gasoline demand associated with summer travel. Planned maintenance at our butane dial facility in 1 of our 2 propylene oxide units located at our Channelview, Texas site is expected to impact second quarter EBITDA for Intermediates and Derivatives segment by approximately $80 million.  Over the past 2 weeks, we declared force majeure for several acetyl products due to equipment failure at our La Porte, Texas site. If we are successful in restarting acetyls production during May, we are currently estimating a second quarter EBITDA impact for the downtime of approximately $50 million.  Now let's move forward and review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 16. Improving volumes from automotive production and higher margins resulted in first quarter EBITDA of $125 million, $101 million higher than the fourth quarter. Prior quarter results were impacted by LIFO inventory valuation charges of approximately $55 million.  Compounding and solutions results increased $40 million. Volumes increased due to improved demand from automotive parts manufacturers relative to the fourth quarter. Margins increased through stronger product pricing and improving asset utilization, partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs. Advanced results increased $10 million, driven by increased seasonal roofing demand for Catalloy and higher product prices. We expect results will be similar in the second quarter as automotive recovery continues to drive volumes while rising cost impact margins. The latest IHS production forecast predicts a 4% rise in 2022 global automotive builds and a 9% increase in 2023. Unfortunately, these reduced forecast delay a return to prior peak production levels until 2025.  Now please turn to Slide 17 and discuss the results of our Refining segment. Our first quarter EBITDA was $148 million, a decrease of $2 million. Prior quarter results benefited from LIFO inventory valuation changes of approximately $50 million. In the first quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 benchmark expanded significantly to $30.82 per barrel, a $7.24 increase due to higher demand for gasoline and diesel partially offset by lower byproduct value. We operated the refinery at 95% of nameplate capacity with an average crude throughput of 255,000 barrels per day. In April, Refining margins continue to expand with increasing demand for transportation fuels. We expect refining markets will remain favorable during the summer months.  Please turn to Slide 18 as we review the results for our Technology segment. First quarter EBITDA was $103 million, $70 million lower than the prior quarter's record level. The results were driven by lower licensing revenue and higher catalyst volumes and margins. We expect that second quarter profitability for our technology business will be slightly higher than the first quarter based on the anticipated timing of licensing revenue milestones.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. Ken? Thank you, Michael. As I mentioned earlier, last week, we announced our decision to exit the crude oil refining business no later than the end of 2023. While these decisions are never easy, operation of the refinery beyond next year would require significant capital investment. After thoroughly analyzing our options, we determined that exiting the business was the best path forward.  Our intention is to safely operate the refinery at full range through the end of next year to meet strong market demand for transportation fuels. During that time, we will continue to consider potential transactions and alternatives for the site. As mentioned earlier, by exiting refining, LyondellBasell will make substantial progress in reducing the company's greenhouse gas emissions.  In addition, the refinery is located on 700 acres in the center of one of the world's leading integrated petrochemical hubs. The site's unique location provides LyondellBasell with valuable options for future growth, including further development of our circular businesses. We recognize that this decision affects our employees, their families and the community. Our employees and contractors at the refinery have delivered outstanding performance in safety, reliability, cost improvement and profitability over the past several years. We sincerely thank them for their contributions, and we are committed to supporting our people through this transition.  Now let me summarize the first quarter and our outlook with Slide 19. With all of the turbulence in the global economy, LyondellBasell's first quarter results illustrate the benefits of our global business portfolio and how demand for our products is highly resilient. While Asia is suffering from weak markets and historically low margins, demand in Europe and the Americas remains remarkably strong and consistent. Improving margins in our Intermediates and Derivatives segment offset first quarter margin compression in our O&P-Americas business. We expect PE chain margins to improve with higher seasonal demand supporting polymer price increases. Also, increased demand for transportation fuels is driving a recovery from pandemic-related weakness in our oxyfuels and Refining businesses. As a result, we expect cash generation will remain strong at LyondellBasell.  Just like our earnings, we are stepping up in our progress on sustainability. Today, we talked about a few of our collaborations with customers to develop circular and renewable products for meaningful applications. We are exiting refining and entering into agreements for the supply of renewable power that will drive significant progress on our path toward decarbonization. And we are raising our targets and expanding on our disclosures in our latest sustainability report.  We remain committed to prudent capital allocation. With robust cash generation, we plan to continue rewarding shareholders through a growing dividend and share repurchases. We are consistent in our commitment to an investment-grade balance sheet and remain highly disciplined in our consideration of organic and inorganic growth investments.  The coming months are exciting times for LyondellBasell. Our businesses are generating resilient results despite volatile economic conditions. We are laying the groundwork for new, more sustainable business models that are likely to reshape value chains across our industry. And later this year, we will be starting up our new propylene oxide and oxyfuel assets during a period of robust margins and strong market demand.  Finally, on May 23, I look forward to welcoming our next CEO, Peter Vanacker, to lead LyondellBasell. I hope you share my enthusiasm about the future of our company under his leadership.  We're now pleased to take your questions. . Our first question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho. This is Kieran on for Chris. I was wondering if you could just touch a little bit more in terms of what operating rates you're expecting in O&P-Americas in 2Q and throughout the year and maybe how you see that supporting what have been announced price increases throughout the second quarter and throughout the rest of the year? Thank you for your question. We are -- as we've said during the remarks, we are still very bullish on the demand outlook, especially in the Americas. So we see demand being very strong. We had a record sales month in the month of March for polyethylene in the Americas. And we see April actually looking to improve on that. So we're -- our outlook is that we'll continue to see operating rates, effective rates probably in the 90% or higher range. So that's going to be very supportive for the price increases that are in the market today. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Polyethylene prices in China continue to fall. Maybe if you look at the month forward prices, maybe they're down $100 a ton to 13 30, something like that. What do you make of that, in that I would have thought that profitability was pretty poor even at higher prices, and there's been a movement upward in the other regions? And maybe you can also comment on the changing profitability of your Bora cracker. Jeff, thank you for your question. I hope you're doing well. Yes. So China, definitely, we've been seeing headwinds there. A lot of that related still to the COVID lockdowns. As you can imagine, the demand profile in China is quite challenging today with the amount of lockdowns that we see. Also, that's going to have an impact on some of the supply chain situation that we've seen.  So prices today have basically been moving pretty much with feedstock in China. And when you look across the industry there, you do see all of the crackers, all the operators of crackers, they are cutting back on rates. So even for us at the Bora joint venture, we've reduced rates, and we've got a first quartile asset. So we do expect that in the coming months, what's going to happen is you're going to see a reset around inventory. Inventories are not high in China by any means, and you're going to see the inventory come down. And then I expect you're going to see demand come back. That reopening impact is still to come in China. And so while yes, in the short term, we're seeing some challenges around profitability with the cracker assets in China. As I look out in the next few months, I expect that's going to reverse and you're going to see a snapback in demand. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. I have a couple of questions about your Circulen products and perhaps about the Renew, which is derived from the renewable naphtha that you get from Neste. Do you see that as challenged longer term because that feedstock is -- can go into renewable diesel and get lots of credits and why not pursue kind of a carbohydrate path for that feedstocks such as ethanol-sourced ethylene? Thank you, Steve, for your question. Yes. So we're very proud of the product portfolio that we're developing. As we've said before, we're looking forward to being a leader in the area of circularity and launch of our Circulen brand globally last year, you're beginning to see the fruits of that effort in the products that we've been developing together with customers today.  In our portfolio, as we look forward, the CirculenRenew part of our portfolio will probably be the smaller segment for us. We are much more bullish on our ability to develop the advanced recycling and mechanical recycling parts of our business. Those really fit very well with our technical capabilities around developing new processes, but also the application development that we do together with our customers. So we will continue to look for opportunities to develop the CirculenRenew portfolio, where we see that and where customers are demanding lower CO2 footprint products, which is primarily why you want those CirculenRenew products. But remember, when you're doing recycling, people are driving recycled content. So there is a little bit of a different value proposition for those 2 products in the marketplace. Our next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. This is Bhavesh Lodaya for John. So in the I&D segment, clearly, very impressive results, especially in the first quarter. Now within the first quarter, a lot changed in March with the spike in crude. So could you describe or maybe break out the earnings seen in March versus the rest of the quarter? And then you mentioned that you expect oxyfuels earnings to return to more of a normalized earnings level this year. What would that new norm be? Thanks, Bhavesh, for the question. Yes. Look, Intermediates & Derivatives really had a very strong quarter, record first quarter for that segment. We did see, as the quarter progressed, especially even relative to the fourth quarter, margins recovered, strong demand pretty much across the portfolio. We got a little bit of relief on butane and the feedstock in the feed slate there. So all of those things are going to be very constructive as we go into the second quarter. Demand for all of the product lines that we have are continuing to look very good, and margins are going to continue to be above average.  So as Michael said in the prepared comments, we do believe that we're going to get those businesses back to a more normal level, but I would expect that they're go","['Unidentified Analyst', 'Bhavesh Lodaya', 'Stephen Byrne', 'Jeffrey Zekauskas', 'Operator', 'Michael McMurray', 'Kenneth Lane', 'David Kinney']"
1,AXP,1,2022,2022-04-22 10:21:04,"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the American Express Q1 2022 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.  As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Vivian Zhou. Please, go ahead. Thank you, Alan, and thank you all for joining today's call. As a reminder, before we begin, today's discussion contains forward-looking statements about the company's future business and financial performance. These are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements are included in today's presentation slides and in our reports on filed with the SEC. The discussion today also contains non-GAAP financial measures. The comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this quarter's earnings materials, as well as the earnings materials for the prior periods we discussed. All of these are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We will begin today with Steve Squeri, Chairman and CEO, who will start with some remarks about the company's progress and results; and then Jeff Campbell, Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed review of our financial performance. After that, we will move to Q&A on the results with both Steve and Jeff. With that, let me turn it over to Steve. Thanks, Vivian, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter earnings call. At our Investor Day last month, we took you through a detailed discussion of our strategies for driving sustainable growth across our businesses and explain why we are confident we can achieve our growth plan aspirations for 2024 and beyond. As we said then, our confidence is based on three interrelated factors: the success of the strategy we've been pursuing over the past several years, which focuses on investing in our brand, customers, value propositions, coverage, technology and talent to build share, scale and relevance. The momentum we've been generating through the effective execution of that strategy; and a number of structural shifts in the payment industry that are contributing to our momentum. The strong first quarter results we announced today are tracking in line with our expectations for the full year, despite the uncertain macro environment, and they reinforce our confidence in our ability to achieve our longer-term aspirations. For the quarter, revenues were $11.7 billion, up 29% year-over-year, and earnings were -- earnings per share were $2.73. These results reflect continued momentum in our core business in areas that are critical to sustainable long-term growth, including customer acquisition, engagement and retention, as well as outstanding credit performance. New proprietary card acquisitions remain at their strong pace, reaching three million this quarter, which continues to be driven by strong demand for our premium fee-based products, particularly among Millennial and Gen Z consumers, and small and medium-sized businesses in the US. We had an all-time high in acquisitions of US Consumer Platinum and Gold cards, as well as US business Platinum Cards this quarter. Delta card acquisitions reached an all-time monthly high in March, an indication of the growing demand for travel-related products and services. Regarding customer engagement, we look at a variety of indicators to measure progress. For example, Card Member engagement with our digital capabilities continues to grow with daily active users across the web and mobile, up double digits over last year. We're also seeing strong engagement with the new benefits we added to our -- recently regressed consumer Platinum card, particularly among millennial and Gen Z card members nearly half in whom have used at least one of the new travel and lifestyle benefits to-date. And we continue to see an acceleration in customer engage with our resi dining platform, including strong double-digit growth over the last quarter in a number of Amex cards on file and a number of restaurants participating in our global dining access program. March was one of resi's best months on record for reservations, up nearly 16% over February. Ultimately, the key metric to gauge customer engagement is spending growth. Overall bill business grew 35% in Q1 global year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis, and we saw our highest volumes ever in March, surpassing our previous highest of December of 2021. Spending growth was led by the acceleration of volumes from millennial and Gen Z consumers up 56% and SME is up 30% on an FX adjusted basis over last year. Goods and services spending continued to accelerate in the quarter, growing 21% on an FX adjusted basis over last year. Travel and entertainment spending was up 121% globally on an FX adjusted basis year-over-year, driven by strong growth in consumer travel spending. Customer retention remains at the very high levels I mentioned at Investor Day, an indication of the value our customers continue to place in Amex membership. A major contributor to our success across all of these areas is the ongoing expansion of many partnerships, which go well beyond our large strategic partners like Delta, Hilton and Amazon. We continue to extend relationships with a variety of companies that are adding differentiated value to our membership model. For example, last week, we announced a new financial advice service with Vanguard, exclusive for our U.S. consumer card members, which brings together Vanguard's digital financial planning and investment management expertise with our industry-leading membership rewards. This is just the latest example of how we're expanding our value propositions beyond their traditional card offerings to meet more of our customers' financial and lifestyle needs. In addition, we're accelerating our focus on fintechs to drive more innovation, including our new partnership with i2c, which will enable fintechs to more seamlessly and quickly issue new products on the American Express network. We also continue to make progress on our ESG initiatives, which are important components of our overall business strategy because we recognize that when our customers, communities and colleagues thrive so does our company. On a diversity equity inclusion front, we are more than three quarters away towards our goal of investing $1 billion in a wide range of actions by 2024, including increasing spend with diverse suppliers, providing resources and financial assistance to minority-owned SMEs in the U.S. and maintaining pay equity across genders globally and ethnicities in the U.S. among other efforts. Our DEI progress was cited as one of the key reasons, along with our flexible work policies for our number eight ranking on Fortune's 2022 list of the Best U.S. companies to work for, which was announced last week. This is the third consecutive year we've been in the top 10, which helps us attract and retain talent. And we recently announced a series of initiatives coinciding with Earth Month that are designed to engage our customers, community partners and colleagues in our climate efforts including the goal of significantly expanding the use of recycled plastic in our card products. These initiatives build on the work we've already done and continue our efforts to reduce our own carbon footprint, including our commitment to net-zero carbon emissions by 2035. In summary, with this solid start to the year, the continued tailwinds we expect from the ongoing recovery from the pandemic, we're reaffirming our full year guidance of delivering revenue growth in the range of 18% to 20% and earnings per share of between $9.25 and $9.65. Furthermore, we remain confident that successful execution of our strategy will position us well as we seek to achieve our long-term growth plan aspirations of revenue growth in excess of 10% and mid-teens EPS growth in 2024 and beyond. I'll now turn it over to Jeff for a deeper dive on the quarter. Thank you. Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's great to be here to talk about our first quarter results, which reflect a solid start to 2022 and are tracking in line with the guidance we gave for the full year and with our aspiration to build growth momentum beyond 2022. Starting with our summary financials on slide 2. Most importantly, our first quarter revenues were $11.7 billion, up 31% on an FX-adjusted basis, consistent with the momentum we have built and our longer-term growth aspirations. Our reported first quarter net income was $2.1 billion with earnings per share of $2.73. As you know, year-over-year comparisons of net income have been challenging for the industry over the past two years due to the volatility that the pandemic has caused in credit reserve adjustments. For that reason, we thought it would be a helpful supplemental disclosure this quarter to include our pre-tax pre-provision income. That number was $2.7 billion in the first quarter, up 16% versus the comparable number in 2021, reflecting growth in our core earnings. So now let's get into a little more detailed look at our results, starting with volumes. As you can see in our slides, we have mostly gone back to reporting our volumes on a year-over-year basis, moving away from the comparisons to 2019 that we have done in recent quarters. We think that returning to a focus on year-over-year comparison gives you a better view of the momentum we have built and the momentum we are seeking to maintain as we look towards our longer term growth objectives. Starting on slide 3. Total network volumes and build business were both up over 30% year-over-year in the first quarter on an FX adjusted basis, strengthening further from the strong growth rates seen in the past few quarters. And as Steve highlighted, intra-quarter, while Omicron slowed growth in January and early February, we then saw a strong acceleration in March, with that month achieving our highest ever level of monthly build business. And I would point out that the majority of this high level of growth was driven by the momentum we have built and the number of transactions flowing through our network with only a modest impact from inflation. Now as I talked about at our Investor Day last month and as slide 4 reiterates, the majority of our build business is spending on goods and services from our consumer and small and medium sized enterprise customers. And as you can see on slide 5, business service spending remained robust in the first quarter with year-over-year growth reaching 21%, slightly above the 2021 exit rate. This momentum is from strong growth in online and card not present spending that continued in the first quarter even as offline spending growth strengthened, demonstrating the effect of the structural shift in online commerce that we've seen accelerated by the pandemic. And while T&E spending is a smaller portion of our total billings, you see on slide 6 that it is now strongly supporting our growth momentum, with overall T&E spending growing 121% year-over-year. T&E spending did show a dip in January and early February due to the Omicron variant, but spending rebounded tremendously, reflecting pent-up travel demand and essentially reached 2019 levels for the first time since the start of the pandemic in the month of March. And this kind of T&E spending growth has continued right into early April. When you then break these spending trends down across our consumer and commercial businesses, as we begin to do on slide 7, there are a few other key points I'd suggest you take fully. First, our millennial and Gen Z customers continue to drive our highest consumer growth with their spending up 56% year-over-year and spending growth from all other age cohorts increasing as well in the quarter. Also of note, global consumer T&E volumes overall were back above 2019 levels as of the first quarter, led by the growth in the US. Second, our commercial businesses strategic focus on helping SME clients run their businesses continues to drive strong growth in overall SME spending, up 30% in the first quarter with acceleration in growth across both the US and international. While a smaller part of our overall growth is in this segment, I would point out that our large and global corporate clients have begun to show signs of business travel recovery, especially in the latter part of the quarter with a year-over-year growth rate for the quarter of 42%. So overall, we are pleased with the growth momentum we see across the board in our spending volumes, which is tracking in line with our expectations for both the year and for our long-term expectations. As you then move to receivable and loan balances on slide 9, you see that our growth momentum has brought our ending loan balances roughly back to pre-pandemic levels in this quarter. As I said at Investor Day, the interest-bearing portion of our loan balances also continues to increase quarter-over-quarter, but is still below 2019 levels as pay down rates remain elevated due to the liquidity and strength amongst our customer base. This liquidity and strength is also, of course, evident as you turn to credit and provision on slides 10 through 12, as we continue to see extremely strong credit performance. Card Member loans and receivables write-off and delinquency rates remain well below pre-pandemic levels and in line with our expectations, but they did tick up a bit this quarter. As you then turn to the accounting for this credit performance, you will see that this quarter, we released a large part of the remaining credit reserves we built to capture the significant uncertainty of the pandemic, which lacked a comparable precedent. As we have seen a sustained recovery from the pandemic-driven economic shutdowns, we have been able to reduce pandemic-driven reserves. While there clearly is still plenty of uncertainty today related to the current geopolitical and inflationary environment, we believe that our CECL models are better able to capture our expected credit risk related to these uncertainties to determine the appropriate level of reserves required. Our strong credit performance combined with the adjustment to our reserves drove a $33 million provision expense benefit for the first quarter as the low write-offs were fully offset by the net reserve release as shown on slide 11. As you see on slide 12, we ended the first quarter with $3.1 billion of reserves, representing 3.3% of our loan balances and 0.1% of our card member receivable balances, respectively. This is well below the reserve levels we had pre-pandemic, given the strong credit performance we've seen. Going forward, as loan balances, especially the interest-bearing portion of loan balances, build more meaningfully, we expect delinquency and loss rates to continue to slowly move up over time, but remain below pre-pandemic levels this year. We would also expect to end the year with a higher level of reserves on our balance sheet than where we ended this quarter, although there could be some quarterly volatility in reserve adjustments throughout the year. As we move to revenue on slide 13, I do need to explain some changes we've made to our revenue reporting before moving on to results. As a reminder, we began reporting processed volumes in the first quarter of last year to better differentiate between volume and cards we issue versus those who are we play more of a network role. For added transparency, we now have moved all of the revenues associated with these volumes out of discount revenue, other fees and commissions, other revenue and combined them into a newly created line called Processed Revenue, which you can then match up against our processed volumes. We have also consolidated the remaining balances from other fees and commissions and other revenue into one line named Service Fees and Other Revenue with the largest components of this line item being service fees earned from merchants like those generated by our loyalty coalition business; and foreign currency-related revenues, such as FX conversion fees. This revenue line was up strong with 42% growth year-over-year in the first quarter, as you will see on the next slide. This growth was primarily driven by the uptick we have seen in travel-related revenues. And as I said at Investor Day, we expect this to be a pandemic recovery tailwind throughout this year. You will see we have recast prior periods in the disclosures that accompany our earnings release. A description of these reporting changes and definitions for key terms will also be included in our Form 10-Q. With these changes out of the way, let's move to our actual revenue performance beginning on slide 14. Total revenues were up 29% year-over-year in the first quarter with broad-based revenue growth across all lines. Our largest revenue line, discount revenue grew 38% year-over-year in Q1 on an FX adjusted basis, as you can see on slide 15. This growth was driven by both our sustained growth in goods and services spending and continued recovery of T&E spending. Net card fee revenues were up 16% year-over-year in the first quarter on an FX-adjusted basis, with growth reaccelerating versus the 10% to 11% growth rate seen in 2021 as you can see on slide 16. As I said at Investor Day, this growth is largely driven by bringing new accounts onto our fee-paying products as a result of the investments we've made in our premium value propositions and the continued attractive of those value propositions to both prospects and existing customers. This quarter, we acquired 3 million new cards with acquisitions of US consumer and US business Platinum Card members reaching record high, as Steve noted earlier, demonstrating great demand for our products, especially our premium fee-based products. Moving on to net interest income. On slide 17, you will see that it surpassed 2019 levels for the first time this quarter, mainly driven by lower interest expense, in part due to our increased mix of deposits, which is generally our lowest cost funding source, particularly in today's rising rate environment. First quarter year-over-year net interest income growth of 20%, while very strong, remains slower than the growth in our lending AR, as revolving loan balances continue to rebuild and so we expect net interest income to be a pandemic recovery tailwind to our revenue growth in 2022. To sum up, on revenues on slide 18, we're tracking well against our expectations. And looking forward, we still expect to see revenue growth of 18% to 20% for the full year of 2022. So all of the revenue momentum, we just discussed, was driven by the investments we've been making in marketing, value propositions, coverage, technology and talent. And those investments show up across the expense lines you see on slide 19. Starting with variable customer engagement expenses, the strong spending growth and customer engagement that Steve discussed earlier is driving the growth in these expenses lines. In total, these costs came in at 41% of total revenues for the first quarter and are tracking in line with our expectations for variable customer engagement costs to right around 42% of total revenues for the full year. On the marketing line, we invested $1.2 billion in the first quarter, on track with our expectation to spend around $5 billion in 2022. We feel really good about the strong momentum of our new card acquisitions, as I talked about earlier. And more importantly, about the revenues from those acquisitions, which is trending significantly higher than what we saw pre-pandemic. We continue to see great demand for our products across a wide range of attractive investment opportunities, even beyond those we are currently funding. Moving to the bottom of slide 19. Operating expenses were $3.1 billion in the first quarter, tracking with our expectation to spend a bit over to $12 billion for the full year. While OpEx was up 26% year-over-year this quarter, it is important to note that we were growing over a benefit of $384 million in net mark-to-market gains in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio from the first quarter of last year, including in the OpEx line. I would point out that, what I said earlier that, inflation is having some modest positive impact on volumes, it is also putting some pressure on our operating expenses, but we'll have to wait to see how material any impact might be for the full year. In any event, I still expect to have far less growth in OpEx compared to revenues and see these costs as a key source of leverage. Turning next to capital, on slide 20, we returned $1.9 billion of capital to our shareholders in the first quarter, including common stock repurchases of $1.5 billion and $394 million in common stock dividends, on the back of strong earnings generation. Our CET1 ratio was 10.4% at the end of the first quarter, within our target range of 10% to 11%. We plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while supporting our balance sheet growth. That brings me to our growth plan on slide 21, and then we'll open up the call for your questions. For the full year 2022, we are reaffirming our guidance of having revenue growth of 18% to 20% and earnings share between $9.25 and $9.65. We continue to expect the amount of our volumes, revenues and core earnings to sequentially strengthen throughout the year, driven in part by our pandemic recovery tailwinds. As I mentioned earlier, clearly uncertainty as it relates to the current geopolitical and inflationary environment. As we sit here today, despite that uncertainty, the combination of our investments, successful execution of our strategy and a number of structural shifts have all come together to deliver our strong first quarter results and build growth momentum. We remain committed to executing against our new growth plan and running the company with a focus on achieving our aspiration of delivering revenue growth in excess of 10% and mid-teens EPS growth on a sustainable basis in 2024 and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Vivian. Thank you, Jeff. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will now open up the line for questions. Alan?  Our first question will come from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Go ahead please. Thanks. Good morning. Obviously, the T&E rebound is happening at a brisk pace despite some of these lingering concerns on COVID cases, economic weakness. Jeff, you mentioned large corporate also that recently saw a strong rebound recently. Could you talk about how much of the volume rebound is being driven by unit demand versus sort of inflationary pressures? And how worried are you or your corporate clients about some of these issues like supply chain constraints and the economic concerns? Thanks. So let me start and Jeff can maybe add some color as well. But this is not being driven by inflation, try and book a flight. So that's not inflation. Now that doesn't mean that the airline prices are not a little bit higher. But not just for T&E, but just for the overall business, transactions are up. We had billings up 35%. That's not sort of driven all by inflation. We don't have 35% of inflation. But -- as far as travel goes, you have to realize, people have not been traveling for probably two years. There's a tremendous pent-up demand for travel. I mean our bookings, just from a consumer perspective, on a global basis were up about 38% -- 37%. In the U.S., they were up 48%. That's not over last year. That's over 2019. So people are looking to get out there and travel. And I think that's what's driving us. That is not -- it is not inflation driven when we look at that T&E number. The other thing I think is important with the T&E number, 121% is a great number, but also let's put it in context. Is 121% over last year, it's not 121% over 2019. So we're not all the way back. Consumers back, but we're not all the way back. As far as large corporations go, and we're seeing it in our own company, people are looking to get out and not only gather with their own colleagues, but they're also looking to get out and meet with customers. You're seeing conferences come back and so forth. And so I know in our own company, we are getting together as a senior management team, our top 100, 150 people. We have some sales meetings that are going on because people have not seen each other, as well as you're seeing customers opening up their offices. And I think as far as COVID affecting all of this, I think we are starting to learn to live with this. The reality is COVID is not something I think we've all learned that is going away. We'll wind up dealing with this as we deal with the flu, as we deal with Scepter, as we deal with other viruses, people will continue to get have colds and get sick and off will go. But I think the world is opening back up at this point, and people are excited to go out and see the world again, both from a business perspective and from a consumer perspective. The only thing I would briefly add, Sanjay, is when you think about travel and entertainment spend, some of that increase is not so much inflation as it is a return to people buying more front of airplane or high-end hotel or high-end restaurant oriented. Some of that is the business travel rebound where your average business travel purchase is, of course, much higher than the average consumer purchase. The other comment I'd make going forward is there's certainly lots of uncertainty in the world. But when you look at everything we see in our actual results and business, you just can't really see any sign of weakness that that's causing as of today. Our next question will come from the line of Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. Go ahead please. Good morning Steve and Jeff. Good morning Mihir. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. A lot has changed since guidance was initially set. And I am curious if you could maybe just talk about how your plans for the year have been evolving since they were established? Are there areas that made sense to lean into now versus what you had thought coming into the year versus maybe pulling back in others? Like I guess I'm just trying to understand the flexibility in the model, particularly on the expense side in terms of as things change, what's changing under the hood even as you maintain guidance? Maybe just give us a flavor of that? Thank you. Yeah. I think as far as flexibility, I think we demonstrated we have tremendous flexibility during the pandemic, especially as that related to our marketing expenditures. And, obviously, as consumers and business travelers didn't use cost -- our card member services, you saw flexibility there. So that -- so those things we do have some control over. But as far as the plan and the guidance that we have, we feel really comfortable where we are from a $9.25 to $9.65. But more importantly, I think we feel comfortable on what we are doing day by day to make sure that we are in line with tracking what our 2024 growth aspirations, which is a sustainable 10% revenue and mid-teens EPS. And that's how we're running the company. As far as what we see under the hood, we see, as Jeff mentioned, a range of good investment opportunities and you have to understand, when we see investment opportunities from a card acquisition perspective, they are here today and gone tomorrow. So if you don't act on them, you don't get them. And so we will continue to drive value, shareholder value by continuing to invest in the business and to grow the business for the medium to the long term. And that's been a strategy that's worked for us, and that is going to be how we're going to run it. But right now, if I was to look at the beginning of the year versus now, I probably see better investment opportunities today than I did with the plan. But as we know, those investment opportunities, they pay back over time. And what they do is they set us up better for 2023 and for 2024. So we feel really good about the guidance. We feel really good about the underlying investments that we're making and we'll continue to make. The only sort of simple financial summary, I put to that here – when we gave the guidance for our revenue ambitions are quite ambitious, we feel really good about the momentum we built, but we have more investment opportunities, as I said in my remarks, than we probably anticipated, and maybe a little bit of pressure on costs from inflation. So all of those things, I think, position us really well to build momentum towards our long-term target of sustainable over 10% revenue growth. Our next question will come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Go ahead. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning, John. So given the expected Fed moves to cool the economy and team inflation, what degree of slowing in network volumes or build business volumes, let's go with do you incorporate in your outlook? And then on the T&E side, I know you indicated, it's up nicely and continues in April. How do you view this trend being as the Fed tightens and the economy cools through the year? There’s been general comment, I would make, John, as you know, we don't have in-house economists. So we tend to say, we should run the economy and run our guide to run the business, run our guidance based on the macroeconomic consensus, which is not for there to be a recession. And the Fed will say that, they are certainly focused on bringing inflation down without causing a recession. So that's what's built into our guidance, and that's how we're running the company. I think as Steve pointed out earlier, we have clearly demonstrated over the last couple of years, our ability to manage the company in a very agile way and react to a scenario that's different than what I just described. But in terms of our base level of planning, I don't think it's our role to second guess that general macroeconomic consensus. Our next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead. Hi. Good morning. Hi, Betsy. Hi, Betsy. I wanted to just dig in a little bit on the loan growth and the card fee growth. As you indicated, the loan growth is – still has room to run. So maybe – and as well the impact on the NII. So maybe you could help us understand, is it the NII that's likely to accelerate here, but loan growth will be stabilizing, or how are you thinking about that? And also how it relates to the card fees, which I noticed were up nicely in the quarter? Thanks. Well, card fees are up because we continue to acquire more cards, and we're continuing to acquire. And I think we acquired 68% of the consumer cards we acquired were fee-based cards, which is still slightly below where we were, I think, pre-pandemic. So what is – what is important to understand is our card -- the majority of our card fee growth comes from new cards that we acquire. So, it doesn't just come from the fee increase, but we've also had a fee increase, which will come in over time. So, we feel really good about where we are from a card fee perspective. Let me just make one comment on sort of our overall loan growth, and then Jeff can get into the details. But the reality is pre-pandemic, we were growing slightly faster than the industry. We tend to have a lower share of our card members loan wallets than we do have their spending wallet. And our intent is to grow judiciously, but we will probably hope to get back to growing and -- we are growing fast we are growing faster than the industry, but to get our balances back up. But I'll let Jeff comment on the rest. Well, I just emphasize financial location, Steve, of what you just said, which is we are now that growing those lending balances faster than the industry, and we absolutely expect that to continue. So, there's a lot of runway for growth on the lending side. And because of quarters like we just had with a record level of new US platinum and Gold Cards on the consumer side and a record level of US business Platinums, I'd expect net car fee growth to probab","['Steve Squeri', 'Mihir Bhatia', 'Steve Squeri ', 'John Pancari', 'Vivian Zhou', 'Betsy Graseck', 'Jeff Campbell', 'Operator', 'Sanjay Sakhrani']"
2,VZ,1,2022,2022-04-22 12:27:05,"Good morning, and welcome to the Verizon First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open up for questions following the presentation.  Today’s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn over the call to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thanks, Angela. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I’m here with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. Before we get started, I’d like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon’s filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. Now let’s take a look at consolidated earnings for the first quarter. In the first quarter, we reported earnings of $1.09 per share on a GAAP basis. Reported first quarter earnings include a pretax loss from special items of approximately $1.5 billion. This includes a pretax loss of approximately $1.2 billion from early debt redemption costs. In addition, the impact of amortization of intangible assets related to TracFone and other acquisitions was $238 million. Excluding the effects of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.35 in the first quarter. With that, I’ll now turn the call over to Hans to take us through a recap of the first quarter. Thank you, Brady. Good morning and thanks for joining us for this earnings call. It was great to see so many of you at our Investor Day earlier in March. During the first quarter, the team stayed focused and continued to execute on our Network as a Service strategy. This strategy underpins our five vectors of growth and a diverse path to revenue growth that set us apart and set us up for today and tomorrow. To that end, I’m pleased with the progress we made across our five vectors during the first quarter. We continued to make headway towards our long-term targets and delivered a solid start to the year, even in the phase of competitive and macroeconomic pressures. Matt will go deeper on these topics later on. With that, let’s get into results at the high level. Our first quarter adjusted EPS results of $1.35 proves our ability to execute and deliver profitability. This demonstrates our unique position of having both a focused strategy and strong execution capabilities to meet the needs of our four stakeholders in the growing 5G economy. It all starts with our network expansion and execution. As you’ve heard me say many, many times, mobility, broadband and cloud are the essential pieces of the 21st century’s infrastructure. We’re already taking advantage of this infrastructure and capitalizing on an addressable market that is growing as consumers and businesses adopt 5G. We saw this growth in our wireless sales, our customer loyalty and the rapid expansion of our fixed wireless business in this quarter. Across the business, our wireless activations were up 11% year-over-year and we delivered our best Q1 full net add performance since 2018. Additionally, our fixed wireless started to benefit from the launch of C-Band during the quarter, helping to amplify our national broadband strategy and deliver our highest broadband net adds in over a decade. We continue to deploy C-Band rapidly, enabling more and more of our customers to enjoy our Ultra Wideband experience, while also accelerating and amplifying our 5G revenue opportunities. A strategic pillar in our network expansion is our C-Band build-out, which combined with our continued millimeter wave rollout further establish and strengthens our network leadership with RootMetrics ranking us again as the most reliable 5G network in the United States and we have just started with the C-Band deployment. At the Super Bowl, we demonstrated the power of 5G to deliver new in-stadium and home experiences. For example, fans streaming the halftime show had access to multiple camera angles over our network to fully immerse in the entertainment experience, only something that can be done with 5G Ultra. This is just a taste of the new customer experience we and our partners are beginning to build on 5G Ultra. This is all based on a strong belief in giving our customers maximum optionality like Mix & Match, multi-cloud partners that allow our business customer choice for the digital transformation on 5G mobile edge compute, choice on premium experience with Verizon Up and choices of streaming services with exclusive deals only on Verizon. Just this week, we announced HBO Max will be offered on our +play platform. We’re empowering our customers to choose the services they need and we’re delivering on it. Our  focus is reflected in our first quarter results as we saw continued momentum with step-ups and elevated device upgrades from our customers. As we previously mentioned, as technology megatrends further shift how we will work and live, 2022 is a year for Verizon to scale execution. The world continues to transition toward increased connectivity and the telecommunications industry’s role in building our future has never been more vital. Through our key investments across our portfolio of assets, we will continue to build on our unique competitive position in the industry and drive growth across all of our five vectors. As we said before, 5G adoption is already much faster than what we saw when we changed from 3G to 4G. A year after 4G launched, less than 10% of the users had a compatible device. A year after the launch of 5G Dynamic Spectrum Sharing, about 24% of our customers were on 5G devices. 5G device penetration is significant and we expect it will reach 60% of our wireless consumers by the end of 2023, up from 40% at the end of the first quarter. Let me now talk about the momentum in our Business Group. Verizon Business Group continues to have a very strong momentum in wireless. I’m proud to report that Tami and her team delivered the best quarterly full net adds since we formed Verizon Business Group and they are just getting started. We’re also rapidly building our 5G mobile edge compute and private 5G networks. Verizon was first in the industry to offer MEC services. This quarter we partnered with Cisco to deliver the low latency connectivity necessary for autonomous vehicles. As a partner of choice across all categories, we also made our first 5G agreement with a premium global automaker, and we will bring 5G connectivity to the next generation of Audi models starting with their 2024 vehicles. This IoT momentum expands across all our verticals with another strong net add performance this quarter. We’re also seeing very promising progress in our private 5G network capabilities, offering small, mid-market and large enterprise clients, turnkey plug-and-play services. I’m also pleased to share that our C-Band launched an aggressive execution to generated nationwide customer enthusiasm for our broadband offerings. Total new broadband customers were the highest in over a decade, with 229,000 net adds driven by a strong increase of 194,000 fixed wireless access net adds. And this is not the one-off. You can see from the current broadband trends that the demand for fixed wireless is extremely high and growing. In the consumer business, we grew postpaid average revenue per account by 2.6% as our users upgraded new 5G packages. ARPA growth is a major part of the strategy that we presented at the Investor Day. In the value market, the TracFone integration continues to unlock an addressable consumer market that we have only just scratched the surface on. We now have the ability to service customers in all segments regardless of the macroeconomic outlook. Manon and I were very encouraged by this opportunity and see tremendous value in the customer base Eduardo and his team have cultivated under the TracFone umbrella. The migration of TracFone subscribers from other networks continues according to plan. In addition to the result in 5G mobility, nationwide broadband, MEC and business to business and the value segment, we also see ongoing momentum in the fifth vector network monetization with growth in volumes driving incremental revenues. Of course, all of this opportunity is built on top of the best network in the industry and the deployment of our 5G Ultra Wideband technology. Kyle and team now have more than 35,000 millimeter wave sites on air and approximately 113 million POPs covered at quarter end with C-Band. As deployment continues and device penetration ramps, traffic on our Ultra Wideband is increasing rapidly. At the end of the first quarter, 14% of all traffic in urban areas was on 5G Ultra, the result of our combined millimeter wave and mid-band spectrum. We saw a 35% increase in millimeter wave traffic between Q4 2021 and Q1 2022. C-Band traffic grew 155% from the end of February to the end of March, where C-Band is deployed, 30% of our wireless traffic uses that spectrum. We have achieved this network evolution in the phase of ongoing supply chain disruption. As I mentioned in previous quarters, our supply chain management is world-class. And we have planned and executed extremely well to anticipate and meet the needs of our customers. We continue to work with our partners with a focus on our deployment targets. We remain diligent in managing a complex global supply chain and count on our expertise to help us to deal with the unexpected. As you come to expect from our technology team, progress is being made throughout our network. In March, we announced a major milestone in the advancement of our 5G network as we work with two satellite companies to secure early clearing of an additional 100 megahertz of C-Band spectrum in 30 additional markets. Rolling out our C-Band service on this spectrum will expand our 5G market by 40 million potential customers, a full year ahead of schedule. We expect to reach at least 175 million POPs by the end of 2022 on C-Band. Early spectrum clearance gives us the speed to market and accelerates the return on capital for our network investments. Having early access to these 30 major markets will support our entire business. It adds consumers and business to our addressable market. And we know from experience that we see customer interest for fixed wireless access as soon as it is available. Our network expansion also supports our mission of digital inclusion, which is key to how we serve our four stakeholders and execute our strategy according to responsible business practices. Let me spend a minute on our progress in this area. Today, we released our detailed environmental, social and governance report for 2021, and we are proud of our progress. The report covers our ESG strategy in detail and reflects how responsible business practices drive our business. During the first quarter, we completed allocating proceeds from our third green bond offering and issued our fourth $1 billion green bond, which is expected to be allocated towards renewable energy. We also continue to pursue long-term carbon footprint goals as described in previous quarters and in our ESG report. Third quarters have taken notice. We continue to be recognized for our sustainability efforts. During the quarter, MSCI raised our ESG rating to AA, our highest rating to date. And Sustainalytics ranked us strong in ESG risk management and low in overall ESG risk, putting us above our U.S. telecom competitors. As always, what it means to be responsible business depends on global conditions. I’m proud of Verizon’s relief efforts to support Ukraine, including extending free calling to and from Ukraine since the start of the war. Taken together, Verizon remains well positioned to compete this year. Our first quarter performance puts us on track for this pivotal investment year, and we remain well positioned to achieve our long-term growth targets. Now I will hand the call over to Matt to address our results in detail, as well as some updates on the 2022 guidance. Thank you, Hans. And good morning, everyone. At our Investor Day last month, we talked about 2022 as a critical year for scaling the business and making investments to position Verizon for the long-term. And this quarter, we may progress along that path. At that event, we said we expect to generate an incremental $14 billion of service and other revenue from the business by 2025, and that we expect to get there through leveraging our unique collection of assets against our five growth vectors. We expect over 75% of our growth over the next four years will come from 5G mobility and nationwide broadband. And our performance in the first quarter gives us confidence in our growth prospects. Our consumer and business units will measure success in mobility by how we perform in the areas of ARPA, premium unlimited penetration and subscribers and accounts. We’ve talked about our plans for increasing the value of our existing base of wireless customers through step up to higher value data plans. The first quarter saw us achieve an increase in consumer postpaid ARPA of 2.6% year-over-year, positioning us for high quality revenue and earnings growth going forward. 64% of new accounts selected premium unlimited, and together with continued step-up momentum drove our premium penetration up to 36%. With respect to subscribers and new accounts, for the first quarter, we reported postpaid phone net losses of 36,000, which represents an improvement of 142,000 or 80% from a year ago and our best first quarter performance since 2018. The performance was driven by our business team, which contributed a record 256,000 phone net adds, the highest from the unit since Verizon 2.0 reporting began. These results were driven by strength in the three wireless customer groups as SMB, Enterprise, and Public Sector, each delivered double digit phone gross ad growth and extended the momentum built in the second half of last year. We expect this strong performance to continue as we approach something closer to a pre pandemic environment. On the Consumer side phone net losses were 292,000 in the quarter. While churn was study, we saw a decline in phone gross adds of 2% from the prior year. This gross add trend was more pronounced in March and is continuing into April. We will continue to take appropriate measures to be competitive in the market. We are pleased with the quality of the business that we are writing and are confident in the value of the postpaid phone gross adds we are attracting. Our retail postpaid accounts at the end of Q1 across Consumer and Business are up 40,000 from last year. Consumer and Business segment performance in the nationwide broadband vector was strong and demonstrates the opportunity to scale this business. We measure our success against this vector by households and businesses covered by broadband and the total subscribers on our networks. As Hans mentioned, the early clearance spectrum announcement is a major milestone for Verizon. Our network team is now able to deploy this spectrum a full year sooner than expected unlocking another 40 million of addressable population. We feel confident that our C-Band network will cover at least 175 million POPs by the end of this year, and will cover 50 million household and 14 million businesses with fixed wireless access by the end of 2025. The addressable opportunity expansion continues in Fios as well with 115,000 incremental open for sale in the quarter. We are seeing strong uptake in our broadband offers, and we expect increasing momentum as more and more people get access to our 5G Ultra Wideband and find service throughout the year. We had 194,000 fixed wireless access net adds across the portfolio, which is 2.5 times our 4Q 2021 performance. Consumers continue to see the benefit of the speed, reliability, and simplicity of installation of the FWA product. And businesses continue to recognize that FWA can be a primary broadband access solution for all of their needs. The total broadband, we registered 229,000 net ads representing our highest net ads in over a decade. Fios Internet contributed 60,000 net ads within the quarter, driven by record low levels of churn. Now let’s move on to the MEC & B2B solutions vector. Tami and the team continue to make great progress in this space. Within IoT, the team delivered another strong quarter of connection growth. We’re seeing success across our verticals, working with our customers to deliver the solutions that they need. As we mentioned during our Investor Day, we anticipate that connections will continue to grow at a double-digit pace. With our investments and key partnerships, we continue to expand the ecosystem for MEC, as well as advance our deployments in private wireless and private MEC. Our market differentiation is unmatched in terms of scale and capabilities. And we are well positioned to accelerate our long-term revenue growth within this space. Now, let’s talk about the value market. Q1 marks a first full quarter of TracFone included in our consumer results. Our integration of TracFone is going as planned, and we are pleased with the progress we are making. We measure our success in the value market based on prepaid ARPU, prepaid subscribers, and prepaid revenue. Prepaid ARPU in the quarter was $30.89 across all of our prepaid brands. This declined in part because TracFone ARPU is lower than our legacy Verizon prepaid ARPU. Additionally, we saw quarter-over-quarter pressure specifically in the TracFone brands in part due to the transition from the Emergency Broadband Benefit program to the affordable connectivity program, which negatively impacted ARPUs benefits dropped from $50 to $30. Going forward, we expect prepaid ARPU to stabilize and subsequently grow as we execute in our strategy to bring additional value to this space. While we experience certain device inventory pressure throughout the quarter, especially in January, the team finished strong and delivered first quarter volumes in TracFone that compare favorably to of prior years, excluding 2021 activity, which benefited from stimulus programs. Our TracFone brands had net prepaid losses of $77,000, while total Verizon prepaid net losses in the quarter were $80,000. Next let’s move to the consolidated financial results on Slide 14. On a consolidated basis, Verizon delivered strong wireless service revenue growth in a highly competitive environment in the first quarter. Total wireless service revenue growth was 9.5%, reflecting the first full quarter of TracFone ownership, as well as continued execution of our Network-as-a-Service strategy and contributions from our five vectors of growth. Service and other revenue was down 2.5% in the quarter, as the revenues lost from Verizon Media more than offset net incremental revenue from TracFone. Excluding the impact of the sale of Verizon Media, service and other revenue was up 4.2% from the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was $12.0 billion in for the quarter down year-over-year by 1.1% do in part to elevated marketing expenses. We introduced our 5G Ultra Campaign at the beginning of the year to support our C-Band launch and FWA expansion. Combined with lower spending on the first quarter of 2021 driven by COVID-related impacts on our operations, marketing expenses represented a year-over-year drag on first quarter EBITDA growth. Other items impacting Q1 EBITDA including the disposition of Verizon Media, which had EBITDA levels above those that TracFone added in the quarter, especially considering the investment we’re starting to put into the TracFone brands. We expect marketing expenses to return to more normal levels in Q2. And we will begin to lap the prior year ramp up in tower expenses, which also represented a year-over-year pressure in Q1. As Brady and Hans highlighted, adjusted EPS for the first quarter was a $1.35, relatively in line with prior year. The bottom-line performance shows the strength of our core business to deliver profitability, even in a period of significant investment, as well as other headwinds. Now let’s take a look at our Consumer financial results in Q1. Total Consumer revenue for the quarter grew 10.9% year-over-year, driven by first full quarter of TracFone inclusion, higher equipment revenue, and strong core wireless service revenue growth. Wireless service revenue was up 11.2% year-over-year. These results were driven by the inclusion of TracFone as well as our increase in postpaid ARPA, which was driven by the strong step-up momentum I discussed earlier and growth within our non-connectivity products and services. Moving to File Services, we continue to see volume and rate gains with broadband of setting pressures from video and voice as total files revenue grew 1.8%. Consumer EBITDA was $10.5 billion up year-over-year by 1.0%. This growth is a result of the inclusion TracFone as well as ARPA and customer volume gains, partially offset by the items mentioned earlier, such as higher marketing expenses, investments in TracFone and higher bad debt, driven mainly by higher sales volumes in the quarter. Similarly, the higher sales activity resulted in elevated equipment revenue, pressuring EBITDA margins, which were 41.4% in the quarter. Margins were additionally pressured by the inclusion of the results of TracFone, which is a business that has historically operated with margins below the legacy consumer business. Now let’s take a closer look at the business financial results on Slide 16. The Verizon Business Group continues to see strong wireless sales and service momentum within the business space, alongside the ongoing wireline service declines. Wireless service revenue growth of 2.1% was led by momentum in our SMB Group, which continues to see strong post-pandemic recovery. The rate of growth is an improvement from last quarter’s 1.5% and with 1Q last year representing the peak for distance learning devices, we expect Business wireless service revenue growth to expand over the rest of 2022. Business EBITDA was $1.7 billion for the quarter, down 9.3% from the prior year. The decline in EBITDA was driven in part by the ongoing reduction in high margin wireline revenue. Additionally, we experienced elevated levels of subsidy related to the strong wireless Q1 sales volume, which were up 20% year-over-year. EBITDA margin was 22.5%, similarly impacted by wireline service trends and wireless sales volumes. Let’s move to Slide 17, the cashflow summary. Cashflow from operating activities for the quarter totaled $6.8 billion, compared with $9.7 billion from the prior year. The reduction was primarily due to working capital impacts as the increase in activation volumes to more normal levels impacted receivables and inventory increased as part of our supply chain management in the current environment. Capital spending for the first quarter, totaled $5.8 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion compared to last year, driven by C-Band spending of $1.5 billion. The continued build out of OneFiber and our investment to support growth of traffic on our 4G LTE network while expanding the reach and capacity of our 5G Ultra Wideband network great extends our opportunity to effectively compete in all of our businesses. The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow for the quarter of $1.0 billion. We exited the quarter with $135.6 billion of net unsecured debt, an increase of $1.9 billion sequentially as we issued our fourth Green Bond, with the net proceeds expected to be allocated to renewable energy. In addition, we completed a number of other transactions during the quarter the proceeds of which were used as consideration in an over $5 billion tender offer to retire some higher cost, long-term debt. We ended the quarter with a net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 2.8 times flat on a sequential basis as expected. Lastly, let’s move to guidance to the remainder of the year. I want to provide some additional detail around our view of the macro environment in which we operate and give context around our guidance for 2022. We saw inflationary pressures building towards the end of the first quarter and expect those to continue given the current environment. The major areas of exposure for us at energy related costs for our network operations and transportation, as well as labor related costs, including both our direct workforce and third parties. While these items have not had a significant impact on our overall results to date, they represent a meaningful portion of our direct cost structure and have the potential to drive additional expense pressure throughout the rest of the year. We also believe that the inflation we are seeing throughout the economy may alter both the consumer and business landscaping, which we compete. It is too early to predict how this change landscape may impact our near-term results or how long it will last. But we are confident that the strategy we have put in place will allow us to achieve our long-term growth plans. There’s also been a significant increase in treasury yields recently, but as a reminder, the vast majority of our debt approximately 75% to 80% is fixed rate. The team has kept near-term maturities in the next 12 months to 24 months at manageable levels, which also helps minimize near-term interest rate exposure. If the present forecast of Fed rate hikes are accurate, we anticipate an incremental cash interest impact for the year above our early expectations of $150 million to $200 million. Based on our current expectations, we are updating our guidance for the year. On the revenue side, we now anticipate service and other revenue to be approximately flat to 2021, significant items affecting our service and other revenue include USF rate reductions, which are pressuring year-over-year revenue by several hundred million and softness in wireline sales. We are keeping the guidance ranges of wireless service revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Based upon our expectations around service and other revenue as well as the macro economic pressures, we now expect to come in towards the lower end of our prior guidance ranges for these items. For CapEx, we are reiterating prior guidance of $16.5 billion to $17.5 billion for business as usual capital and $5 billion to $6 billion to see band related spending. We will continue to invest in the business and remain confident in the long-term growth opportunities discussed during our Investor Day. With that, I’ll turn it over to Hans to close out our 2022 priorities. Thank you, Matt. Our priority about 2022 is to continue to execute on our Network as a Service strategy and to drive growth across all our five vectors. This is a critical year for scaling on our strategic investment as we work to capture all of the promise that 5G offers both from a customer experience perspective and for a future revenue growth. We made good progress in this quarter and continue to execute on our long-term plans. Our core business and our strategy showed strength and we have a solid momentum going into the second quarter, all built on the strong confidence in our strategy. Now we’re ready to take your questions. Back to you Brady. Thanks, Hans. Angela, we’re ready for questions. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  First question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question. Great. Thanks. I guess two quick follow-ups to all the data you guys provided. First on the EBB reimbursements, is the impact to ARPU that we saw the $5 change, is that fully reflect the changes in reimbursements. And is there any impact from a customer standpoint? And then on consumer margins, they were down 400 basis points, is that – can you separate out the impact from TracFone had and sort of underlying trends and what was driving that and just your outlook for the how it actually trend through the year. Thanks. Hey John, so good morning. Thanks for the questions. On the EEB messaging as a certainly we’re seeing that change in the programs as we go forward here, but no major impact on customer volumes related to that. I think your bigger question on Verizon Consumer Group and the margins we saw in the quarter. So a couple of major things in there, certainly some so one time increases in costs as we look at the quarter. We were very, very strong on our marketing spend this quarter with the launch of C-Band, new price plans, launch of fixed wireless on C-Band as well and everything around that. So that’s in the quarter we would expect that to be returned to more normal levels as we head here into second quarter and go forward. And then of course, you saw the volumes up year-over-year that has some impact in there, and then Trac I mentioned in my prepared remarks so that has an impact. Initially that’s going to be in the 100 to 200 basis point range impact as you bring Trac into the overall VCG mix. And then as we work through the integration and bring all of the customers in Trac onto our network that impact will lessen as we complete the integration over the next 12 months to 24 months. So combination of things in there, but certainly would expect to see a little bit of an uptake as we head into the rest of the year here on the – our consumer margin. Got it. Yes. Great. Thanks, John. Angela, we’re ready for the next question. Our next question comes from Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. Yes, thank you for taking the question. So during your prepared remarks, I think you had noted that postpaid phone gross adds had started to soften towards the end of the quarter, and that had continued into 2Q. I was hoping you could let us know what insights you’ve gained into what’s behind that. In other words, to what extent do you think it has to do with lower market volumes or perhaps a shift in porting ratios and some of the steps that you’re going to be implementing to sort of stabilize that. And then just on the cash flow, Matt, to what extent was the higher working capital use in the first quarter really a timing issue, obviously pre-buying inventory to manage the supply chain seems like a timing factor, but I guess with regards to just the elevated volumes, do you expect to ultimately have that offset either by selling off the receivables or just collecting the payments or was any of that actually associated with maybe a little bit more of a device promotion profile in the first quarter. Thank you. I start Brett and then Matt will support later on there. First of all, I mean if you look at the quarter, we had a very good wireless net adds quarter of course because if you look over the combination, our business side was very strong. Consumer also had a good quarter, but a little bit slowness as we said in the prepared remarks in March. However, if you think about it, its logical I mean a competition is higher as we’ve seen now for a while, because we’re coming into the second phase of the 5G era and acquisition of 5G customers or sort of an important piece in the market. And what we see is of course, a really good traction for us. I mean our share levels are still very low. We’re doing well. We’re doing upgrades and step ups all the time. So and that’s our focus, then of course, as we always say, we look into the market and we will take measured actions if it’s needed. That’s we’ve done all the time and being very financially disciplined when we come into the market with the offerings and see if there’s something we need to do. But right now I feel really good where we are. We’re actually with our launch, our Ultra in the beginning of the year, it’s really kept made us in a total different situation because our network is just fant","['Matt Ellis', 'Hans Vestberg', 'Brady Connor', 'Operator', 'John Hodulik', 'Brett Feldman']"
3,AVGO,1,2022,2022-03-03 20:49:10,"Welcome to Broadcom Inc.’s First Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Ji Yoo, Director of Investor Relations of Broadcom Inc. Thank you, Sheri, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me on today’s call are Hock Tan, President and CEO; Kirsten Spears, Chief Financial Officer; Tom Krause, President, Broadcom Software Group; and Charlie Kawwas, Chief Operating Officer. Broadcom also distributed a press release and financial tables after the market close describing our financial performance for the first quarter fiscal year 2022. If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the information from the Investors section of Broadcom’s website at broadcom.com. This conference call is being webcast live, and a recording will be available via telephone playback for one week. It will also be archived in the Investors section of our website at broadcom.com. During the prepared comments, Hock and Kirsten will be providing details of our first quarter fiscal year 2022 results, guidance for our second quarter as well as commentary regarding the business environment. We’ll take questions after the end of our prepared comments. Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call. In addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Broadcom reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today’s press release. Comments made during today’s call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results. I’ll now turn the call over to Hock. Right. Thank you, Ji. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. So in our fiscal Q1 2022, consolidated net revenue was a record $7.7 billion, up 16% year-on-year. Semiconductor solutions revenue grew 20% year-on-year to $5.9 billion and infrastructure software revenue grew 5% year-on-year to $1.8 billion. Now enterprise demand grew very robustly from the trough we saw in Q1 last year as the recovery in enterprise IT spending continued to accelerate. Meanwhile, hyper clouds are upgrading their data centers, and service providers, telcos continue to deploy next-generation fiber-to-the-home. As expected, against the peak of a year ago, wireless grew single digits, and our core software business remains very stable and steady. On the supply front, lead times remain extended and unchanged as inventory of our products in the channel and in our customers remains lean. Our semiconductor backlog at the close of Q1 continued to grow double digits from that of the prior quarter. Let me now provide more color by end markets, starting with networking. Networking revenue of $1.9 billion was up 33% year-on-year and represented 32% of our semiconductor revenue. This strong growth was driven by deployment at scale of Tomahawk 4 and compute off loan across several hyperscale customers, as they upgrade and scale out their data centers. In enterprises, campus switching upgrades continue to accelerate. Let me talk about routing in this space. Investments in 5G backhaul by telco operators worldwide continue to drive strong growth in our Qumran family of products. More than this, the opportunity in our routing silicon has expanded into hyperscale in a very significant way, moving Ethernet into the back-end network of large-scale AI/ML clusters. In particular, I’m referring to the Arista’s 7800 AI platform, which scales Ethernet to connect many tens of thousands of CPUs and GPUs in hyperscale. This platform is built on our Jericho router. Our devices provide the most cost-effective fabric for AI/ML scaler with an end-to-end congestion managed lossless network and highest efficiency load balancing across the links. Now in contrast to proprietary protocols such as InfiniBand used typically in high-performance computing, we see low-latency Ethernet as the way forward for large-scale AI/ ML networks as a widely adopted open architecture. Our unique ability to network these complex AI workloads in hyperscale is extending our customized training and inference SoC footprint at several cloud guys. In Q2, we expect networking to continue to be strong across the board and revenue growth to be in excess of 30% year-over-year. Next, our server storage connectivity revenue was $801 million, and growth accelerated to 32% year-on-year, representing 14% of semiconductor revenue. This was driven in large part by the continuing recovery of enterprise IT spending, much of which was deployed towards upgrading compute service. And most of these compute service use either our MegaRAID or SAN for server storage connectivity. We are also benefiting from increased content as enterprises upgrade to next-generation storage connectivity solutions to support deployment of leading-edge service. Beyond enterprise, with proliferation of video content in social media, we see our cloud customers increasingly adopting Nearline hard disk drives as the primary storage of choice. And to manage this much arrays of hard disk drives, they deploy storage service and expanders, which utilize very much our next-generation storage connectivity, silicon and software, creating another driver for revenue growth. Interestingly, we are also a critical supply of preamplifiers and re-channels in Nearline hard disk drives, with our revenue growing at over 20% CAGR over the last five years. Our Nearline revenue represented over two-thirds of our hard drive business this quarter. With the adoption of next-generation technology here, we’re selling more bots than just silicon, resulting in much higher dollar content. This dynamic, coupled with continuing strong demand from both enterprise and hyperscale is expected to accelerate Q2 server storage connectivity revenue to over 55% year-on-year. Now moving on to broadband. Revenue of $911 million grew 23% year-on-year and represented 16% of semiconductor revenue. This was driven largely by increased deployment of next-generation PON and DOCSIS, our cable modem, with high attach rates of Wi-Fi 6 and 6E in home gateways. Examples of this about, last quarter, Charter announced trials of DOCSIS 4.0 running at speeds of 8.5 gigabit downstream and 6 gigabit upstream, both in CPE and remote note. Comcast start the deployment of their Wi-Fi 6E DOCSIS 3.1 gateway, and AT&T announced a multi-gig PON service on their gateways. All of these are using Broadcom SoCs. We remain the market leader in delivering Wi-Fi 6 and 6E chips to leading phones as well as routers, enterprise access point and carrier gateways. Through the first quarter of 2022, we have cumulatively shipped over 1 billion Wi-Fi 6 and 6E radios in just around three years since our launch. Our OEM customers and carrier partners are now ramping Wi-Fi 6E, the current generation of Wi-Fi making use of the 6 gigahertz band, which has increasingly been made available for unlicensed access across the globe. And as we look ahead, we are the industry leader, heavily investing in Wi-Fi 7 as the strategic complement to 10G PON and cable modem – we see – both broadband. We see this as the next step in broadband development and deployment globally. In the U.S. alone, the pending infrastructure access to site $65 billion over the next five years to connect more homes to high-speed broadband. Across the world, the same is happening as next-generation wide broadband is seen as the better alternative to 5G for home connectivity. As far as Q2 is concerned, we expect our broadband business to continue to grow 20% year-on-year. Moving on to wireless. Q1 revenue of $2 billion represented 34% of semiconductor revenue. Demand from our North American customer for our products continued to be strong during the quarter, driving wireless revenue up 10% sequentially and up 4% year-on-year from the peak quarter in fiscal 2021. As expected in Q2, wireless revenue will be seasonally down, about mid-teens quarter-on-quarter, but will still be up mid-single digits from a year ago. Finally, industrial revenue of $243 million represented approximately 4% of Q1 semiconductor revenue. Q1 resales of $239 million grew 37% year-over-year driven by robust demand from electric vehicles, renewable energy, factory automation and health care. Reflecting such strong resales, our inventory in the channel remain around one month, and we expect resales to continue to be strong in Q2. Accordingly, in summary, Q1 semiconductor solution revenue was up 20% year-on-year. Q2, we expect semiconductor revenue to accelerate to 25% year-on-year. Turning to software. In Q1, infrastructure software revenue of $1.8 billion grew 5% year-on-year and represented 24% of total revenue. Core software revenue grew 6% year-on-year. In dollar terms, consolidated renewal rates averaged 121% over expiring contracts, while in our strategic accounts, we averaged 136%. Within this strategic account, $656 million represented renewals on expiring contracts, of which $164 million represented cross-selling, including PLAs, of our portfolio products to the same customers. Over 90% of the renewal value represented recurring subscription and maintenance. Okay. ARR, annual recurring revenue, at the end of Q1 was $5.3 billion, which was up 5% from a year ago. In Q2, we expect our infrastructure software revenue to sustain around mid-single-digit percentage growth year-upon-year. In summary, in Q1, semiconductor revenue grew a strong 20%. In fact, excluding wireless, it grew – actually grew over 30%. Combined with our stable software business, consolidated revenue grew 16% year-on-year to $7.7 billion. Now turning to Q2 guidance. We expect semiconductor revenue growth will accelerate to 25% year-upon-year. And excluding wireless, it will be 35% year-on-year. Layering on our stable software business, we expect Q2 consolidated revenue growth of 20% year-on-year to $7.9 billion. And before I turn this call over to Kirsten, I just want to add, Broadcom recently published its second annual ESG report available on the company’s corporate citizenship site, which discusses the company’s ESG initiatives. As a global technology leader, we recognized the company’s responsibility to have a positive impact on our communities through our product and technology innovation and operational excellence, we remain very committed to this mission. With that, let me turn the call over to Kirsten. Thank you, Hock. Let me now provide additional detail on our financial performance. Revenue was $7.7 billion for the quarter, up 16% from a year ago. Gross margins were 76% of revenue in the quarter and up 227 basis points year-on-year. Operating expenses were $1.2 billion, up 6% year-on-year, driven by investment in research and development. Operating income for the quarter was $4.7 billion and was up 23% from a year ago. Operating margin was 60% of revenue, up approximately 362 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.8 billion or 62.5% of revenue. Note that this figure excludes $136 million of depreciation. Now a review of the P& L for our two segments. Revenue for our semiconductor solutions segment was $5.9 billion and represented 76% of total revenue in the quarter. This was up 20% year-on-year. Gross margins for our semiconductor solutions segment were approximately 71%, up 347 basis points year-on-year, driven by favorable product mix and content growth in next-generation products across our extensive product portfolio. Operating expenses were $817 million in Q1, up 9% year-on-year. R&D was $725 million in the quarter, up 10% year-on-year. Q1 semiconductor operating margins increased to 57%. So while semiconductor revenue was up 20%, operating profit grew 31%. Moving to the P&L for our infrastructure software segment. Revenue for infrastructure software was $1.8 billion and represented 24% of revenue. This was up 5% year-on-year. Gross margins for infrastructure software were 90% in the quarter, up 71 basis points year-over-year. Operating expenses were $348 million in the quarter, up 1% year-over-year. Infrastructure software operating margin was 71% in Q1, and operating profit grew 7%. Moving to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $3.4 billion, representing 44% of revenue. We spent $101 million on capital expenditures. Days sales outstanding were 30 days in the first quarter compared to 35 days a year ago. We ended the first quarter with inventory of $1.5 billion, up 17% from the end of the prior quarter, in large part due to higher material costs. Our hardware backlog at the end of the quarter was over $25 billion compared to $22 billion the preceding quarter. And our lead times remain steady at 50 weeks. Our software backlog continued to grow as well and ended the quarter at over $15 billion. As a point of reference, software backlog was $13 billion a year ago. We ended the quarter with $10.2 billion of cash and $39.5 billion of gross debt, of which $300 million is short term. Turning to capital allocation. In the quarter, we paid stockholders $1.8 billion of cash dividends. Consistent with our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, we repurchased $2.7 billion in common stock and eliminated $375 million of common stock for taxes due on vesting of employee equity, resulting in the elimination of approximately 5 million AVGO shares. The non-GAAP diluted share count in Q1 was $446 million. Based on current business trends and conditions, our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 is for consolidated revenues of $7.9 billion and adjusted EBITDA of approximately 62.5% of projected revenue. Note that we expect Q2 non-GAAP diluted share count to be 442 million. This excludes the potential impact of any share repurchases completed in the second quarter. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions. Thank you.  Our first question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Good afternoon and congratulations on the strong results and execution. Hock, given your backlog and extended lead times, you’ve got pretty good visibility into this year. Your end markets are strong, right? Cloud and hyperscale CapEx spending is looking to grow about 30%. You’re driving the 200 and 400 gig networking upgrade cycle. Enterprise spending is still expanding. As you mentioned, Broadcom continues strong, whether it’s DOCSIS, Wi-Fi, fiber upgrades. And then on your compute acceleration ASIC pipeline, you’ve got Google, Facebook, Microsoft, all of these guys ramping. So it seems like the demand, your product leadership, seasonality can sustain a sort of low to mid-20% plus type year-over-year revenue growth profile through this year. So I guess the question for you is, do you have line of sight and confidence on sustaining this type of growth through the year? And then more importantly, do you have the supply commitments to support this type of growth? I’m not providing annual guidance, Harlan, if that’s what you’re angling for. But what you’re saying makes a lot of sense. And to answer your question directly, yes, we have line of sight through end of 2022, both, we believe, in demand and in supply. Thanks, Hock. Thank you. Our next question will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Thank you for taking my question. Hock, I was hoping if you could just revisit what’s driving the acceleration in growth. And then the more important question is that there is a perception that semiconductor companies are benefiting abnormally because of a pricing lever because of the tight supply conditions. And as the foundry capacity eases, that your costs will go down and the pricing advantage will disappear. And I was hoping you could give us some more color, how much of a role is pricing playing in the expected sales growth this year on a like-to-like basis versus what you saw last year? That’s a very good question. And I mean, and true, the rail demand that we’re seeing underlying – if you talk about underlying trend that is sustainable, at least in this typical up cycle, you’re right, it’s – while we’re showing 30% in networking, in server storage, a part of it is driven by ASP increases simply because we are passing on our material cost increases, wafer, substrates, assembly, to our customers, inevitably. But it’s much less than you probably think it is. What is really sustainable is what Harlan said in the previous question. We think the trend demand increase is more like closer to 20% year-on-year than what perhaps in dollar terms you’re represented. And how long would it last? Who knows? It’s hard for me to figure, because I’ve been wrong so many times, and this is now going on into the almost – 2022 is done and is strong. We’re now booking, given our lead times I indicated, in 2023. And 2023, I think, will be – at least the first half of 2023 will still be pretty close to the same. And it’s the latter part of 2023 and 2024 that we have to figure out whether there’s enough supply that will start coming in to basically address what is today and what we’re seeing, an extremely strong demand environment, whether it’s from enterprise, telcos and service providers and hyperscale, all three are strong. Got it. So price stickiness perhaps can continue into 2023. I just wanted to clarify that. At least the first part of 2023, yes. Thank you, Hock. Thank you. Our next question will come from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Hock, I wanted to ask about gross margins. So you did like 75.5% in the quarter, 71% for semis. And if I sort of like squint at your guidance, it implies gross margins into Q2 at least at that level, if not even probably higher. And this is amid cost increases and everything else. So I mean how do we think about like the limited – I know you always talked about margins kind of going up 100 basis points a year, and they seem to be doing even better than that. Do we just keep modeling them going up from here? Or do you think they take a pause? Are there are any other drivers like into the back of this year mix or anything else that would sit on that? Just how do we think about it just given the levels that they’re sitting at right now? Well, I could tread on my usual statement because it happens to be true, which is year-upon-year under normal situations, yes, we see this 100 – around 100 basis points expansion of gross margin on our semiconductor front. You get that. Now Kirsten just indicated, we did better than that in semiconductor. And I guess the – and the reason why we did better than that this season, so to speak, if you come back to my remarks, there’s a lot of deployment – launch and deployment of new generation products that I mentioned. We’re talking about in networking, Tomahawk 4, and much more, Trident 4, which is more towards some data centers that use in enterprises, come out for use in hyper cloud, that new generation. Then we talk about Jericho being deployed – the latest Jericho being deployed in the bank site networks of machine learning, AI, GPU in the connectivity. That’s a whole new application. Then we talk in service storage, I’ve talked about a whole slew of new generation solutions, which we put in place towards, basically, for new generation, leading-edge service out there from the guys who do those servers. And with those new generation, we get that better margin. So in all, I guess the additional input I put in is a lot more new generation products coming out now, happen to be in 2022 – we’re seeing happen. And of course, we are, in this environment, thankfully, able to pass on our cost increases to supply – to customers. And that all adds up to a fairly decent gross margin set of results. But do not let that be an indicator, please, that it is something that will be a 200, 300 basis points expansion year-on-year. We still believe normal situation is still be just on average, 100 basis point expansion. Got it. But as long as you can keep the new products coming, we should still be able to see that 100 basis points even from here? Yes. And by the way, it’s not just me having to come on new products. There’s a pool. The customers, the applications of our markets require us – and that’s the beautiful thing about the semiconductors and technology, is always – there always is a need for next-generation better products. Whether it’s performance power, whatever, is always, there’s a pool. And that product life cycle is what enables us to develop these new products, and our margins will keep expanding. Got it. That’s helpful. Thank you so much. Thank you. Our next question will come from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Hi, thanks for let me ask a question. Hock, thanks for the information on the backlog for the semi business. It’s good to see that rising as much as it did sequentially, especially considering the lead times stayed flat. While the magnitude is impressive, I really want to ask about the profile of that and how it may or may not be changing. So as that additional backlog comes in, given all the moving parts between enterprise and cloud and broadband and wireless, et cetera, any sort of changes in the profile of that backlog that you find to be interesting, either in a positive or negative sense that will give us a clue about the future growth drivers for your company? That’s a good question. And I employed in some of my point – some of my remarks, but let me take you directly. Yes, enterprise, enterprise demand, spending is the strongest driver that we’re seeing today. And it should be no surprise, because something we have said since last quarter and the quarter before, enterprise has recovered more – than recovered – is going – it’s on fire, is the best way to describe it. Enterprise spending on IT is, as we perceive it, on fire. And we are seeing a big part of that. And that’s not to say that hyper cloud and telcos are not adding to it, but not as strong as enterprise recovery. Any negative surprises in that? You talked about the positive side. Is there anything that’s been surprising on the negative side? No. Not really. It’s just – that’s – I think there’s a lot of pent-up spending. There’s a lot of need for a lot of enterprises to upgrade. And that’s also what’s driving, as I indicated in my remarks, a lot of on-prem campus switching investment going in. I mean look at even Broadcom. We’ve been using Wi-Fi in our hot spots, in our excess gateways, in – through the campus. A key part of it is wireless connectivity, Wi-Fi, so to speak way. I mean we’ve been running Wi-Fi 5 for many years. Now is the time to move to Wi-Fi 6, 6E. And we’re not the only one we’re seeing across the board, very strong demand from lots of enterprises wanting to upgrade connectivity as offices start to slowly open up. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question will come from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Yes, guys. Thanks for let me ask the question. Hock, usually at this point in the cycle with lead times extended as much as they are and you guys getting pricing power, the big concern on Wall Street is to what extent is the demand you’re seeing real demand versus perhaps your customers building inventory. And I know you’re less consumer focused than most. And so maybe inventory builds are less relevant in some of these infrastructure markets. But I’m wondering if you could give us your perspective on – or at least what you guys try to do to scrub the backlog to make sure it’s good demand. And if you think it’s good demand, I’m kind of curious, you’ve always had a very realistic view of what the long-term growth rate for your semi should be – semi business should be. Is that beginning to change? And like many of your peers who have put up a higher kind of new CAGR, are you willing to go there right now? Let’s answer the first question first, and let me go to the last one and the best at the end. But on the first part, yes, as I’ve stated in previous earnings calls, I’m more than happy to reiterate it here, which is we are very, very concerned, obviously, that you could – we could easily build up inventory in various parts of our demand environment, just because we ship according to what customer sending in orders as their customer requested. So we don’t – we actually spend a huge amount of bandwidth of our operations and salespeople in this environment to make sure we get products to any particular customer just when they need it. Not any earlier and hopefully not too late either because we like to address customer a real need in that regard. But what’s very, very important to us is not to ship excessively. And inventory, whether it’s in the customer inventory, in distribution, the nice thing about our business in semiconductor is this, 75% of our revenue comes from just about 100 customers, and they’re direct. The last 25% go through distribution. 75% direct to 100 customers. We have enough salespeople. We have enough visibility on these customers to know exactly pretty closely, we’d like to think, what they need and ship to what exactly they need. And when we do all that, I said it before in last earnings call, true in demand growth – true growth as we have been seeing in 2021, it was about 20% year-on-year improvement. Now we now take on the fact that material costs have gone up in 2022. So there’s an addition beyond 20%. I still believe it’s about 20% in response to earlier in this environment because the last up cycle we saw in 2017, it was 20% year-on-year improvement. It wasn’t stronger than that. And by the way, we sell mostly those big core system on a chip into any platform that our customer builds and sells. We do – and generally, we get very good visibility. If we were to sell more of the peripheral chips, the secondary chips, that adds up to the total platform, and that cause a fraction of what our system on a chip cost. Then perhaps you will not have that visibility, and we believe there are a lot of pockets of those inventory in the wrong places because of unbalanced chipsets sitting out there. But if you – for example, if you’re building a data center and you need 1,000 Tomahawk 4s, believe me, you will not buy more than 1,050 Tomahawk 4s. But if you buying voltage regulator, you probably buy 2,000, 3,000 of those voltage regulators just in case. And that’s the difference in what we’re seeing. So we think we get a good sense of what’s out there. And the kicker here is the price increase that was passed on because of wafer cost and substrate cost increases, which makes it go over perhaps what we think is a sustainable level. Now to answer your longer-term question, no, I don’t think on a long-term, say, next 10 years, would the CAGR change, I think people will say that CAGR change, frankly, are probably dreaming because there’s no evidence on our side to show why this industry, which is relatively mature semiconductor industry, should suddenly spiral into a different trend growth rate. We have seen in the last 10 years, compounded roughly 5% annual growth rate. And there’s nothing to indicate, frankly, why you would not be that way for the next long-term, 10 years. Now it won’t be 5% every year, obviously, we’re not at 5% this year. But on the long-term, I still think that trend has not changed. Perfect. Thank you very much. Sure. Thank you. Our next question will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. Hock, I wanted to ask for your thoughts on capital allocation. It’s been a while since your last meaningful acquisition. A lot of things are going on from a macro perspective. Rates are going up. And obviously, the economy is a little bit squishy. You just spent $2.7 billion on buybacks. Just curious how you’re thinking about allocation of capital. Any changes to how you think about M&A and your appetite for M&A going forward? Thank you so much. Thank you. Well, really, in last quarter, we are very clear about our capital allocation plan, at least for 2022, and which is, frankly, at – we’re still looking for acquisitions. We’ve just been very, very – as we usually do, being very thoughtful and selective about the assets we would acquire. But very much so, we’re still in the market to look for good – great assets to acquire, and we have the capacity to handle it. And in the meantime, given two years, 2020 and 2022 when we haven’t done anything on acquisitions and have been earning and generating lots of cash, we have taken on – other than paying dividends and maintaining the policy on dividends that we have outlined for the long-term, we have decided for fiscal 2022 – for actually calendar 2022 to put out that buyback program of $10 billion. We spent $2.7 billion of it so far, and we have probably most of the year to go. And we’ll probably use – we will likely use all of it up evenly over the next nine months of the remaining year. And that nothing has changed. But – and we believe we still have the capacity to do a good-sized acquisition. Thank you so much. Thank you. Our next question will come from Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research. Please go ahead. Hi, thank you for taking my question. I’d love to hear whatever debt you can give us, Hock, on your I think ASIC business in semiconductors. And what I’m wondering is how is business trending compared to your other segments in semiconductors. And do you see your ASICs taking share overall with your hyperscale clients? Or is that just growing in line with the rest of the market or actually below the rest of the market? Okay. Let me paraphrase my – your question the way I would probably be able to answer it and see if it’s the right thing. What you’re saying is, see, we have a product division that does ASIC custom chips essentially for usually large customers. And that’s a good-sized business for us. And a big part of that business to address what you’re saying here, is address has been used is now currently, though not in the past, but more recently in the last few years, it was the hyperscale players who are starting to develop – wanting to develop their customized and dedicated accelerators for specific functions and workloads mostly related to, for instance, machine learning, AI, also to do with video transcoding and also gradually increasing virtualization and orchestration of data centers. All those have customized silicon accelerators to enable these hyper cloud guys to run their workloads better and more effectively. I believe that was your question. And the best way to answer your question is year-on-year this quarter, Q1, we grew revenue in this offload computing sector, which all ASIC north of 50% revenue year-upon-year. All right? I hope that answers your question. Yes. Thank you. That’s perfect. Thank you so much. Thank you. Our next question will come from Tim Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead. Hi, thanks a lot. Hock, I had a question on your wireless business. It’s been very strong, but you’ve been recently talking about some trade-offs that one of your customers making is – making on the FBAR side, and maybe making it a little even more concentrated on a single customer. And I know that you consider selling this business some time back, but does even – your further revenue concentration, does it make you rethink maybe how committed you want to be to that segment? And maybe whether you could redeploy this capital into another market, especially as things might be changing on the modem side. Thank you. Okay. Good question. And my answer would be very simple and direct. We have always indicated our wireless business is one customer largely, our North American OEM. And you know what, they’re a very good customer. They’re very strategic. And we are not only selling one product but selling multiple products, which are very strategic to us and I believe also very important and strategic to them, which will – which is what makes a partnership very sustaining. I see this as a very long-term sustaining partnership in the sens","['John Pitzer', 'Pierre Ferragu', 'Stacy Rasgon', 'Harlan Sur', 'Ross Seymore', 'Tim Arcuri', 'Ji Yoo', 'Hock Tan', 'Operator', 'Vivek Arya', 'Kirsten Spears', 'Toshiya Hari']"
4,CAT,1,2022,2022-04-28 12:30:35,"Welcome to the First Quarter 2022 Caterpillar Earnings Conference Call. Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ryan Fiedler. Thank you. Please go ahead. Thank you, Emma. Good morning, everyone and welcome to Caterpillar’s first quarter of 2022 earnings call. I am Ryan Fiedler, Director of Investor Relations. Joining me today are Jim Umpleby, Chairman and CEO; Andrew Bonfield, Chief Financial Officer; Kyle Epley, Vice President of the Global Finance Services Division; and Rob Rengel, Senior IR Manager. During our call today, we will be discussing the first quarter earnings release we issued earlier today. You can find our slides, the news release and a video recap at investors.caterpillar.com under Events and Presentations. I would also like to remind everyone that we are hosting Caterpillar’s Investor Day on May 17 from 10:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central Time at the Hilton DFW Lakes Executive Conference Center in Grapevine, Texas. Our theme is services, technology and sustainability, helping our customers build a better world. Please check out the details on our investor website. Caterpillar has copyrighted this call and we prohibit use of any portion of it without our prior written approval. Moving to Slide 2. During our call today, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. We will also make assumptions that could cause our actual results to be different than the information we are sharing with you on this call. Please refer to our recent SEC filings and the forward-looking statements reminder in the news release for details on factors that individually or in aggregate could cause our actual results to vary materially from our forecast. On today’s call, we will also refer to non-GAAP numbers. For a reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers to the appropriate U.S. GAAP numbers, please see the appendix of the earnings call slides. Today, we reported profit per share of $2.86 for the first quarter of 2022 compared with $2.77 of profit per share in the first quarter of 2021. We are including adjusted profit per share in addition to our U.S. GAAP results. Our adjusted profit per share was $2.88 for the first quarter of 2022 compared with adjusted profit per share of $2.87 for the first quarter of 2021. Adjusted profit per share for both quarters excluded restructuring costs. Now, let’s flip to Slide 3 and turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Jim Umpleby. Thanks, Ryan. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I’d like to start by thanking our global team for their contributions to another good quarter. We continue to execute our strategy for long-term profitable growth as demonstrated by our first quarter results. I will begin with my perspectives on our performance in the quarter and then I will provide some insight on our end markets. Before discussing our results, I’d like to take a moment to say we remain deeply saddened by the tragic events continuing to occur in Ukraine and hope for a peaceful resolution. Through the Caterpillar Foundation, we have donated more than $1 million to support both urgent and long-term needs of the Ukraine humanitarian crisis. I am proud of our employees for their generous contributions through the Foundation Matching Gifts program, which added nearly an additional $1 million on support for Ukrainian refugees. On the operations front, we suspended production in our Russian manufacturing facilities and will continue to comply with all applicable laws and evolving sanctions. Moving on to our quarterly results, sales rose in all three of our primary segments due to volume gains and favorable price. Sales and margins were both slightly better than we expected. And similar to the second half of 2021, our top line would have been even stronger without the continuing supply chain constraints. Overall, we remain encouraged by the strong demand for our products and services. The first quarter of 2022 marked the fifth consecutive quarter of higher end user demand compared to the prior year. Services remained strong in the quarter. We continue to make progress on our service initiatives, including customer value agreements, e-commerce, connected assets and prioritized service events. Moving to Slide 4, sales and revenues increased by 14%, slightly better than we expected. The increase was primarily driven by higher end-user demand and the impact of changes in dealer inventories as well as strengthening price realization. The impact of our price actions started to accelerate in the second half of 2021. We generated double-digit sales growth in all primary segments and sales rose in North America, Latin America and EAME. Asia-Pacific was down by 4%. Compared with the first quarter of 2021, sales to users rose 2%, which was about as we expected. For machines, including Construction Industries and Resource Industries, sales to users increased by 3%, while Energy & Transportation decreased 1%. Sales to users in Construction Industries were about flat overall with good growth globally in the first quarter, except for China. North America grew by double-digits as residential construction remained strong and non-residential contributed to show signs of improvement. Latin America saw higher end user demand supported by construction and strong commodity prices. End user demand increased in EAME due to residential growth and support of commodity prices. I will briefly discuss China. In the first quarter of 2021, China’s greater than 10-ton excavator industry was at an all-time high, which resulted in a difficult comparable in the quarter. In the first quarter of 2022, China was lower than we expected due to weaker residential construction and COVID-19-related shutdowns. Overall, sales in China were about half the level we saw in the prior year’s quarter. Keep in mind, China sales are typically 5% to 10% of our enterprise sales. Outside of China, Asia-Pacific sales to users grew as we continue to see strong demand in the region. In Resource Industries, the overall environment remained positive with sales to users up 13%, an improvement from the fourth quarter. Mining increased at a measured pace, which is in line with the expectations that we have been communicating to you for the last couple of years. Strong commodity prices supported a high utilization and a low number of parked trucks. In heavy construction and quarry and aggregates, sales to users increased versus the prior year for the fourth straight quarter as end user demand continues to improve. In Energy & Transportation, sales to users declined 1% versus the prior year. Solar turbines declined as expected due to the timing of projects. Excluding solar, sales to users were strong. Oil and gas sales to users were down in the first quarter with improvement in reciprocating engines more than offset by solar. Despite continued data center and rental demand strength, power generation sales to users were down overall due to timing of some larger projects. Industrial end user demand strengthened across all regions. Lastly, Transportation benefited from growth off a low base, primarily in marine applications. Now, I will spend a moment on dealer inventory. Dealers who are independent businesses increased their inventories by about $1.3 billion in the first quarter. This compares to a $700 million increase in the first quarter of last year. While dealer inventories remain near the low end of the typical range, we continue to work closely with dealers to satisfy higher end user demand. Andrew will provide additional color about dealer inventory later in the call. Regarding ongoing supply constraints, we experienced similar challenges to what we highlighted in the fourth quarter, which was in line with our expectations. We continue to experience constraints with semiconductors and certain other components. Our team continues to implement solutions to help mitigate the overall situation. For example, we executed engineering redesigns to provide customers with alternative options. We also increased dual sourcing of components and placed specialized Caterpillar resources at suppliers to help ease constraints. I remain proud of our global team’s ability to deliver double-digit sales growth despite supply chain challenges. Similar to previous quarters, absent the supply chain constraints, our top line would have been even stronger. When the supply chain conditions ease, we expect to be well positioned to fully meet demand and gain operating leverage from higher volumes. Operating profit increased 2% in the quarter to $1.9 billion driven by strong volume and favorable price realization across all segments, which was partially offset by higher manufacturing cost and SG&A and R&D expenses. The higher manufacturing costs primarily reflected increased material and freight costs in the quarter. While we did see some labor inefficiencies, these were not as significant as they were in the fourth quarter. Operating profit margins were 13.7% in the first quarter, which was lower than the first quarter of 2021. We expect that comparisons would be difficult as inflationary impacts to manufacturing costs accelerated in the back half of 2021 and remained at a similar level in the first quarter of 2022. On a sequential basis, our margins improved versus the fourth quarter as we expected. Our profit per share was $2.86 versus $2.77 in the first quarter of 2021. The adjusted profit per share was $2.88 versus $2.87 in the first quarter of last year. On Slide 5, we had an ME&T free cash outflow of about $400 million in the quarter, which Andrew will discuss in a few moments. To remind you, our Investor Day target is to deliver ME&T free cash flow of between $4 billion and $8 billion per year. We expect to be within that range for the full year 2022. Regarding capital deployment, we completed $800 million of share repurchases and returned $600 million in dividends to shareholders. We remain proud of our dividend aristocrat status. We continue to expect to return substantially all of our ME&T free cash flow to shareholders over time through dividends and share repurchases. Now, I will share some high level assumptions on our expectations for the full year. We expect to achieve our Investor Day targets for adjusted operating profit margins and as I have just mentioned, deliver ME&T free cash flow within our targeted range in 2022. As I previously indicated, we continue to be encouraged by strong order demand across our segments. In the first quarter of 2022, our total backlog increased by $3.4 billion as we experienced continued strong demand and supply chain challenges. Backlog increased in all segments with the largest increase in Energy & Transportation. The environment continues to be challenging due to supply chain constraints and the more recent COVID-19-related shutdowns in China. Although manufacturing costs are expected to remain elevated, we expect price to more than offset these cost increases for the full year. Turning to Slide 6, I will discuss our expectations for key end markets this year. In Construction Industries in North America, residential construction remained strong with non-residential continuing to improve. Despite rising interest rates, infrastructure investment is expected to improve in late 2022 and beyond supported by the U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The 10-ton and above excavator market in China was very strong in 2020 and 2021. We now anticipate this market will be slightly lower than 2019 levels. The rest of Asia-Pacific region is expected to grow due to higher infrastructure spending. In the EAME, despite the broader geopolitical concerns, we remain cautiously optimistic due to housing growth in the EU investment package that is expected to drive construction demand. Construction and mining activity in Latin America are supportive of growth that could be impacted by inflation and interest rate policy decisions. In Resource Industries, we believe commodity prices will continue to drive higher production and utilization levels, which support more investments in equipment and services in 2022 and beyond. Within heavy construction and quarry and aggregates, we also anticipate continued growth in 2022. Lastly, we are seeing increased quoting for our autonomous solutions, which includes large mining trucks, drills, track-type tractors, water trucks and underground machines. In Energy & Transportation, we expect improving momentum in 2022 with strong order rates in most applications. In oil and gas, although customers remain disciplined, we are encouraged by continued strength in reciprocated engine orders, especially for large engine replacements as asset utilization increases. Power generation orders remained healthy due to positive economic growth and continued data center strength. In 2022, while solar services are expected to remain steady, we continue to expect new equipment shipments to be lower than last year due to the lead time of Solar’s products. Solar’s new equipment orders strengthened significantly in the first quarter and shipments are expected to improve in late 2022 or early 2023. Industrial remains healthy with continued momentum in construction, agriculture and electric power. In rail, North American locomotive sales are expected to remain muted, but international locomotives are more promising. We also anticipate growth in high-speed marine as customers upgrade aging fleets. Now on to Slide 7. In 2021 and into the first quarter of 2022, Caterpillar and our customers announced a number of projects that will contribute to a reduced carbon future. We recently entered into an agreement with ioneer, a U.S.-based lithium Boron miner. This will be the first Greenfield site in the U.S. to use autonomous haul trucks. Lithium is a key component for electric – for battery electric vehicles and the minerals from this Nevada mine will help contribute to a more sustainable future. Our autonomous technology is a competitive advantage as it delivers significant benefits to our customers, including improved safety, productivity and efficiency, while lowering greenhouse gas emissions per ton of material removed. Our commitment to sustainable innovation remains strong as we continue to execute our strategy for long-term profitable growth. I look forward to hosting you at our Investor Day on May 17, where we will be talking more about services, technology and sustainability. With that, I will turn the call over to Andrew. Thank you, Jim and good morning everyone. I will begin with a recap of our first quarter results, including the performance of our segments. Then I will comment on the balance sheet and free cash flow before concluding with a few comments on our expectations as we move into the second quarter of 2022. Beginning on Slide 8, sales and revenues for the first quarter increased by 14% or $1.7 billion to $13.6 billion. Volume, including higher dealer inventory build and price drove the increase in sales and revenues, which as Jim mentioned was slightly better than we had expected. Operating profit increased by 2% to $1.9 billion as price realization and volume growth were partially offset by higher manufacturing and period costs. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 13.7% was slightly better than we had anticipated primarily due to the stronger-than-expected volumes and favorable price realization. First quarter profit per share was $2.86 compared to $2.77 in the prior year. Adjusted profit per share was $2.88 in the first quarter compared to $2.87 last year. Adjusted profit per share for both quarters excludes restructuring costs. Our global tax rate in the quarter was about 24%, slightly lower than we had guided you in January. However, on a comparable basis, the lower tax rate was offset by lower favorable discrete tax benefits compared to the prior year. Now on Slide 9, as we anticipated, top line improved on stronger volume and price realization. End user demand increased versus the prior year, but the growth rate accelerated on a sequential basis due to tougher comparisons, especially in China. Dealer inventory rose by about $1.3 billion. Services revenues remained strong in the quarter. Price realization strengthened, while currency was a bit of a headwind. Let me provide some color on dealer inventory. The $1.3 billion increase versus year end 2021 was nearly double what we had anticipated and about $600 million more than the increase we saw in the same quarter last year. About half of that $600 million increase year-on-year came from Resource Industries due to the timing of shipments from our dealers to their customers, which can be lumpy. These units are backed by firm customer orders, but were not recognized in our reported retail sales for the quarter. This is in part due to variations in onsite assembly times. The other half of the deal inventory increase was mainly due to the timing of shipments in Construction Industries late in the quarter. We anticipate that dealers will start to sell down the inventories in the second quarter following their normal seasonable pattern on strong sales to users. Our expectations for the full year haven’t changed and we do not expect to see a significant benefit from dealer restocking in 2022 as end-user demand remains strong. First quarter sales and revenues increased by double-digit percentages in all regions, except Asia-Pacific. Sales in North America rose by 23% with continued growth in the three primary segments. In EAME, sales increased by 15%, while Latin America sales grew by 26%, a 4% decrease in Asia-Pacific sales was primarily due to softening in China. Sales in the remainder of that region were positive. Moving to Slide 10. As I mentioned, first quarter operating profit increased by 2% on favorable price and volume. Price realization was slightly better than we had anticipated. Manufacturing costs remain elevated, but in line with our expectations primarily due to continued material and freight cost headwinds. SG&A and costs increased partly due to investments in services and technologies such as digital, autonomy and electrification. Our first quarter adjusted operating profit margin was 13.7%, a 210 basis point decrease versus the prior year. As we said in our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call, we expected the largest margin headwinds to occur in the first quarter. First quarter margins were lower than the prior year. Favorable price realization did not offset higher manufacturing costs, but did improve compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Margins were slightly better than we had anticipated on stronger price and volume partially offset by higher than expected short-term incentive compensation. I will discuss our expectations for the second quarter and full year margins in a bit more detail later. Moving to Slide 11, let’s review segment performance starting with Construction Industries. Sales increased by 12% in the first quarter to $6.1 billion primarily driven by favorable price realization and strong sales volume. End-user demand improved in three of the four regions. North America had the highest sales growth in sales dollars, a 28% increase, as non-residential demand improved and residential construction remains strong. Sales in Latin America increased by 60% as construction activity supported higher demand, EAME sales increased by 18% primarily due to growth in residential construction demand. However, Asia-Pacific sales decreased by 21% due to a reduction in sales in China, which had a very strong quarter a year ago. The segment’s first quarter profit increased by 1% versus the prior year to $1.1 billion. Price realization and higher sales volume drove the increase more than offsetting increases in manufacturing costs. Price realization was stronger than we had anticipated but lagged manufacturing costs in the quarter. The segment’s operating margin decreased by 180 basis points to 17.3%. Turning to Slide 12. Resource Industries sales increased by 30% in the first quarter to $2.8 billion. The improvement was mostly due to higher end-user demand, the impact from changes in dealer inventories and favorable price. End-user demand increased in heavy construction and quarrying aggregates as well as mining. First quarter profit for Resource Industries increased by 16% to $361 million. Higher sales volume and favorable price realization were partially offset by higher manufacturing costs and increases in SG&A and R&D expenses. Manufacturing cost increases were primarily due to freight and material. The segment’s operating margin decreased by 150 basis points versus last year to 12.8%. Now on Slide 13. Energy & Transportation sales increased by 12% to approximately $5 billion with sales up across all applications. This included a 4% sales increase in oil and gas, including aftermarket parts for reciprocating engines. Power generation sales increased by 5%. Small reciprocating engine sales improved. Solar turbine sales were lower in the quarter for oil and gas and power generation applications, impacted by a higher-than-usual first quarter in 2021. Industrial sales rose by 25%, with strength across all regions. Finally, transportation increased by 9% on reciprocating engine cells for both aftermarket parts and marine applications. Profit for Energy & Transportation decreased by 20% to $538 million. Higher sales volume and price realization were more than offset by higher manufacturing costs, reflecting continued headwinds from freighter material. In addition, SG&A and R&D expenses increased. The segment’s operating margin decreased by 430 basis points versus last year to 10.7%. Let me take a moment to provide a bit more color on Energy & Transportation margins. Seasonally, first quarter margins are typically lower compared to the rest of the year in this segment. However, the first quarter of 2022 proved a bit more challenging due to continued supply chain constraints, including elevated freight and material costs. I’ll discuss very generally, but note that increased freight costs have impacted this segment more than others. Also, Energy & Transportation took price increases later in the year 2021 given the different marketing dynamics as compared to the other primary segments. However, similar to the other segments, we expect margins to improve through 2022 as the benefit of higher price realization starts to pull through. Moving to Slide 14. Financial Products had another good quarter. Revenue increased by 3% to $783 million. Segment profit decreased by 2% to $238 million. Whilst profit was down, this represents our second highest first quarter profit in 8 years. The decrease was mainly due to a higher provision for credit losses at Cat Financial related to reserves associated with Russia and Ukraine. Note, the Russian-Ukraine generally accounts for about 2% of Caterpillar’s enterprise sales and less than 1% of the Cat Financial portfolio. Demand for used equipment remained very strong in the quarter, and that helped mitigate the impact of higher provisions. Moving to our credit portfolio. It remains high quality as customers and dealers continue to perform well in the quarter. Past dues were 2.05%, the best first quarter performance we’ve seen in 15 years. That’s down 85 basis points year-over-year and up just 10 basis points compared to the fourth quarter, which had marked a 15-year low. While new business volume typically decreased versus the fourth quarter, this is typical seasonality. New business volume was our second highest first quarter performance in 8 years, second only to the prior year, which benefited from pent-up demand following COVID-related shutdowns. Regarding interest rate changes, we are in a good position as our matched funding strategy serves to mitigate that risk. We also maintained healthy spreads on new business. Now on Slide 15. We had an ME&T free cash outflow of about $400 million, a decrease of $2.1 billion versus the first quarter of 2021. Let me take a moment to discuss the changes. In a typical year, the first quarter is our weakest from a cash generation perspective, primarily due to the payment of our incentives. We paid approximately $1.3 billion in short-term incentive compensation during the first quarter compared to zero in the prior year. This accounts for the majority of the difference year-over-year. In addition, we continue to build production inventory in the quarter by about $1 billion, which contributed to a negative net working capital impact of approximately $600 million. Despite these first quarter impacts, we continue to expect to achieve our Investor Day free cash flow target of between $4 billion and $8 billion for the full year. Moving to shareholder return. We paid around $600 million in dividends during the first quarter. We also repurchased about $800 million worth of common stock supporting our objective to be in the market on a more consistent basis. Enterprise cash was $6.5 billion, a $2.7 billion decrease compared to the year-end. The $400 million free cash outflow and the $1.4 billion in shareholder returns accounted for the majority of the decrease in our cash position. In addition, we have moved some of our cash balances into slightly longer-dated liquid marketable securities in order to improve the yield on that cash. This amounted to about $800 million in the quarter. Now on Slide 16. In light of the current environment, including supply chain constraints, we continue to refrain from providing annual profit per share guidance. However, I do want to share some thoughts on the second quarter and the full year. The first quarter played out slightly better than we had anticipated on the top line, resulting from higher volume and better-than-expected price tailwinds. Supply chain challenges remained steady, which we expect to continue into the second quarter. Despite these challenges, we anticipate the top line will increase compared to the first quarter and continued strong end user demand and favorable price realization. Looking to the remainder of the year, our order books and backlog remain robust. We expect continued strong end-user demand and pricing, although supply chain challenges will impact the extent to which we will be able to fully meet demand. As I mentioned, we do not expect to see a significant benefit from dealer restocking in 2022. On margins, as we discussed in January, we do not expect a typical year. In a normal year, we’d see strong margins in the first quarter with margins decreasing sequentially through the fourth quarter. However, this year, we expect margins to improve in the second half of the year compared to both the first half and the comparable period of 2021 as the impact of price actions accelerate. Comparisons ease in the back half of the year as well as we let the manufacturing cost increases from the prior year. As Jim mentioned, we continue to expect price to more than offset manufacturing costs for the full year. Specific to the second quarter, we expect similar margins to the prior year as additional price actions should offset manufacturing cost increases. Looking at the second quarter by segment. We do expect margins in both Construction Industries and Resource Industries to be close to or higher than the prior year as price improves and manufacturing cost headwinds are in line with the first quarter. Margin in Energy & Transportation still lag the prior year as the timing of price actions is late as compared to the other segments. However, we expect the lag in the second quarter was not – will not be as significant as it was in the first quarter. As we move into the second half of the year in Energy & Transportation, we expect a reduction in expediting costs and an improvement in efficiencies. Increases in large engine and turbine volumes versus 2021 should also positively contribute to margins in the second half of the year. However, it’s important to note that the majority of our core investments related to the energy transition will impact this segment. Finally, to assist with more modeling, we currently expect to add accrual for short-term incentive compensation expense to be around $1.3 billion this year. We anticipate a global effective tax rate of around 24% and restructuring costs of approximately $600 million for the full year. Turning to Slide 17. In summary, we performed well in a challenging environment. End-user demand remains strong, and we realized $1.7 billion more in revenues. Sales and margins were slightly better than we expected. Looking ahead, comparisons ease in the second half of the year, and we expect to achieve our Investor Day targets of adjusted operating profit margins and ME&T free cash flow. And with that, we will take your questions.  Your first question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is now open. Thanks and good morning, everyone. Good morning, Rob. Good morning, Rob. If I have it right, I think your backlog increased by the most in a decade, maybe one of the couple of best order quarters – implied order quarters you’ve had. And obviously, there is some moving parts you guys addressed the fact that you’d like to ship a little bit more. I don’t know if you can quantify that. I know you’ve done a lot of work with dealers, helping them forecast to get the right levels of inventory rather than too much or too little. I don’t know whether you can sort of give context around that backlog increase, how much more you would have liked to ship. Does dealer optimism drive a lot of it? Or is it really end user demand? Anything you can say to help us out? Thank you. Thanks for your question, Rob. So just in terms of the backlog, the largest backlog increase was actually in Energy & Transportation and as orders continue to strengthen for both solar and for recip oil and gas. And as you know, those products tend to have longer lead times. Having said that, we are certainly working with our dealers to help them satisfy end-user demand. We do have a new S&OP process, and we do feel good about the quality of the orders that we’re getting in E&T and RI, again, which tend to have some of those longer lead times. So again, just a real positive backdrop moving forward. Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Hi, good morning and nice quarter. Thanks, Jamie. Jim, I guess my question, I’ll direct it towards you because it’s with regards to the E&T and you used to run that business. So can you help me understand – the top line was a little lighter than I would have thought. What are you hearing from your oil and gas customers? And how does that impact the trajectory of growth for E&T this year? And then I guess, on the margin side, I understand the puts and takes with solar and pricing having to come through an investment. But is there any way you can help us with how to think about sort of E&T margins as we exit the year, I don’t know if it’s investment – some of the investments you’re making will sort of create pressure on margins, I guess, over the longer term, so, thank you. You bet. Oil and gas customers do continue to display capital discipline. However, we are encouraged by the improvement in orders for both recip and solar. As I mentioned earlier, those products tend to have longer lead times. Higher oil prices are leading to increased utilization and refurbishment of frac assets, and it’s an improved opportunity for pump and flow iron as well. Then in terms of your question around margins, as you can imagine, as volume increases in solar and oil and gas, that will help. Also, we’ve mentioned previously that we took price action in Energy & Transportation around engines later than we did machines. And as those price actions continue to take effect that will also help margins as we move throughout the year. So no structural headwind to margins. Again, certainly, we’re making investments in sustainability and some of the things we’re doing there around alternative drivetrains. So we’re making those investments. But again, the other side of it is, of course, improving volume and price. Okay, thank you. And as I indicated, Jamie, we would expect just the same for the other segment’s margins to improve in the second half of the year in Energy & Transportation. Okay, thanks.","['Jim Umpleby', 'Ryan Fiedler', 'Operator', 'Jamie Cook', 'Andrew Bonfield', 'Rob Wertheimer']"
5,JPM,1,2022,2022-04-13 12:13:07,"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please standby. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead. Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on page 1. The firm reported net income of $8.3 billion, EPS of $2.63 on revenue of $31.6 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 16%. These results include approximately $900 million of credit reserve builds, which I'll cover in more detail shortly, as well as $500 million of losses in Credit Adjustments & Other in CIB. Regarding loan growth, we're continuing to see positive trends with loans up 8% year-on-year and 1% quarter-on-quarter ex PPP with the sequential growth driven by a continued pickup in demand in our Wholesale businesses, including ongoing strength in AWM. On page 2, we have some more detail on our results. Revenue of $31.6 billion was down $1.5 billion or 5% year-on-year. NII ex Markets was up $1 billion or 9% on balance sheet growth and higher rates, partially offset by lower NII from PPP loans. NIR ex Markets was down $2.2 billion or 17% predominantly driven by lower IB fees, lower Home Lending production revenue, losses in Credit Adjustments & Other in CIB as well as investment securities losses in corporate. And Markets revenue was down $300 million or 3% against a record first quarter last year. Expenses of $19.2 billion were up approximately $500 million or 2%, predominantly on higher investments and structural expenses, largely offset by lower volume and revenue-related expenses. Credit costs were $1.5 billion for the quarter. We built $902 million in reserves driven by increasing the probability of downside risks due to high inflation and the war in Ukraine as well as builds for Russia-associated exposures in CIB and AWM. Net charge-offs of $582 million were down year-on-year and comparable to last quarter and remain historically low across our portfolios. On to balance sheet and capital on page 3. Our CET1 ratio ended at 11.9%, down 120 basis points from the prior quarter. As a reminder, we exited the fourth quarter with an elevated buffer to absorb anticipated changes this quarter, the largest being SA-CCR adoption as well as some pickup in seasonal activity. In addition to those anticipated items, there were a couple of other drivers. The rate sell-off led to AOCI drawdowns in our AFS portfolio. But keep in mind, all else equal, these mark-to-market losses accrete back to capital through time and as securities mature. And price increases across commodities resulted in higher counterparty credit and market risk RWA. While, of course, the environment is uncertain, many of these effects are now in the rearview mirror. And as a result, we believe that our current capital and future earnings profile position us well to continue supporting business growth while meeting increasing capital requirements as we look ahead. With that, let's go to our businesses, starting with Consumer & Community Banking on page 4. CCB reported net income of $2.9 billion on revenue of $12.2 billion, which was down 2% year-on-year. In Consumer & Business Banking, revenue was up 8%, predominantly driven by growth in deposit balances and client investment assets, partially offset by deposit margin compression. Deposits were up 18% year-on-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter, consistent with last quarter. And client investment assets were up 9% year-on-year, largely driven by flows in addition to market performance. In Home Lending, revenue was down 20% year-on-year on lower production revenue from both, lower margins and volumes against a very strong quarter last year, largely offset by higher net servicing revenue. Originations of $24.7 billion declined 37% with the rise in rates. And as a result, mortgage loans were down 3%. Moving to Card & Auto. Revenue was down 8% year-on-year, primarily on strong new card account originations, leading to higher acquisition costs. Card outstandings were up 11%, and revolving balances have continued to grow, ending the quarter above the first quarter of '21 levels. And in Auto, originations were $8.4 billion, down 25% due to the lack of vehicle supply, while loans were up 3%. Touching on consumer spend. Combined credit and debit spend was up 21% year-on-year with growth stronger in credit as we see a continued pickup in travel and dining. And as the quarter progressed, we saw a robust reacceleration of T&E spend, up 64%. Expenses of $7.7 billion were up 7% year-on-year, driven by higher investments and structural expenses, partially offset by lower volume and revenue-related expenses. Next, the CIB on page 5. CIB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $13.5 billion for the first quarter. Investment Banking revenue of $2.1 billion was down 28% versus the prior year. IB fees were down 31% year-on-year. We maintained our number one rank with a wallet share of 8%. In Advisory, fees were up 18%, and it was the best first quarter ever, benefiting from the closing of deals announced in 2021. Debt underwriting fees were down 20% primarily driven by leverage finance as issuers contended with market volatility. And in equity underwriting, fees were down 76% on lower issuance activity, particularly in North America and EMEA. Moving to Markets. Total revenue was $8.8 billion, down 3% against a record first quarter last year. Fixed income was relatively flat driven by a decline in securitized products, where rising rates have slowed down the pace of mortgage production, largely offset by growth in currencies and emerging markets and commodities on elevated client activity in a volatile market. Equity markets were down 7% against an all-time record quarter last year. This quarter, however, was our second best with robust client activity across both, derivatives and cash. And prime continued to perform well with client balances hovering around all-time highs. Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $524 million, driven by funding spread widening as well as credit valuation adjustments relating to both, increases in commodities exposures and markdowns of derivatives receivables from Russia-associated counterparties. Let me take a second here to address the widely reported situation in the nickel market as it relates to our results this quarter. We were hedging positions for clients closely linked to nickel producers, who generally sell forward a portion of the coming year's production. The extreme price movements created margin calls, which we and other banks are helping to address. Because this is counterparty related, not trading, it appears in the Credit Adjustments & Other line, where it contributed about $120 million to the reported loss I just mentioned. It also drove approximately half of the increase in market risk RWA that I noted on the capital slide and was a driver of higher reported VaR, which will also be elevated in our upcoming filings. Payments revenue was $1.9 billion, up 33% year-on-year or up 9% excluding net gains on equity investments, driven by continued growth in fees, deposit balances and higher rates. Securities Services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 2% year-on-year, driven by higher rates and growth in fees. Expenses of $7.3 billion were up 3% year-on-year, mostly due to higher structural expenses and investments, largely offset by lower volume and revenue-related expenses. Moving to Commercial Banking on page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $850 million and an ROE of 13%. Revenue of $2.4 billion was flat year-on-year with higher payments revenue and deposit balances, offset by lower Investment Banking revenue. Gross Investment Banking revenue of $729 million was down 35%, driven by both, fewer large deals and less flow activity. Expenses of $1.1 billion were up 17% year-on-year, largely driven by investments in volume and revenue-related expenses. Deposits were down 2% quarter-on-quarter as client balances are seasonally highest at year-end. Loans were up 5% year-on-year and up 3% quarter-on-quarter, excluding PPP. C&I loans were up 3% sequentially ex PPP, reflecting higher revolver utilization and originations across Middle Market and Corporate Client Banking. CRE loans were up 3%, driven by strong loan originations and funding across the portfolio. And then, to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1 billion with a pretax margin of 30%. Revenue of $4.3 billion was up 6% year-on-year as growth in deposits and loans and higher management fees and performance fees and alternative investments were partially offset by deposit margin compression and the absence of investment valuation gains from the prior year. Expenses of $2.9 billion were up 11% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher structural expenses and investments as well as higher volume and revenue-related expenses. For the quarter, net long-term inflows of $19 billion were positive across all channels with strength in equities, multi-asset and alternatives. And in liquidity, we saw net outflows of $52 billion. AUM of $3 trillion and overall client assets of $4.1 trillion, up 4% and 8% year-on-year, respectively, were driven by strong net inflows. And finally, loans were up 3% quarter-on-quarter with continued strength in mortgages and securities-based lending, while deposits were up 9%. Turning to Corporate on page 8. Corporate reported a net loss of $856 million. Revenue was a loss of $881 million, down $408 million year-on-year. NII was up $319 million due to the impact of higher rates, and NIR was down $727 million due to losses on legacy equity investments versus gains last year as well as approximately $400 million of net realized losses on investment securities this quarter. Expenses of $184 million were lower by $692 million year-on-year primarily due to the contribution to the firm's foundation in the prior year. Next, the outlook on page 9. We still expect NII ex Markets to be in excess of $53 billion and adjusted expenses to be approximately $77 billion. And we'll update these and give you more color at Investor Day next month. So to wrap up, once again, this quarter, the Company's performance was strong in a particularly volatile and challenging environment. We helped our clients navigate very difficult markets, provided support to relief efforts and implemented economic sanctions of unprecedented complexity with multiple directives from governments around the world. And of course, our thoughts remain with everyone, including our employees affected by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Looking ahead, the U.S. economy remains robust, but we're watching high inflation, the reversal of QE and rising rates as well as the ongoing effects of the war on the global economy. With that, operator, please open the line for Q&A. And our first question is coming from John McDonald from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good morning, Jeremy. I was wondering about the net interest income outlook. I know it sounds like we'll get more at Investor Day, but it's very similar to what you gave in mid-February. And obviously, rate expectations have advanced since then. Could you give us a little bit of color on what kind of assumptions are underlying the net interest income ex Markets outlook? Yes. Good morning, John, good question. And yes, look, obviously, given what's happened in terms of Fed hike expectations and what's getting questioned into the front of the curve, we would actually expect the access part of in excess of $53 billion to be bigger than it was at Credit Suisse. So, to size that, probably a couple million dollars. But we don't want to get too precise at this point. We want to run our bottoms-up process. We -- there have been very big moves, and we want to get it right. And so, we'll give more detail about that at Investor Day. Okay. And as my follow-up, could you give us some thoughts about the Markets-related NII? What things should we think about there, whether it's seasonality or how it's affected by rising rates? Yes. I guess, I would direct you to my comments, I think, one or two quarters ago on this. But generally speaking, that number is pretty correlated to the short-term rate. So, all else equal, you'll see a headwind in there as the Fed hikes come through, which, in general, in the geography, we would tend to expect that to be offset in NIR. But it's noisy. It can shift as a function of obscure balance sheet composition issues, as I've mentioned in the past. And so, that's why we don't focus too much on that number. The next question is coming from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Jeremy, I just wanted to follow up on your comments about capital and being able to provide room for organic growth. With a 5.2% SLR, 11.9% CET1 versus your longer-term targets, can you talk about what that means in terms of the buyback potential from here? And do any of the RWA inflation items come back off that you just saw in the first quarter? Thanks. Yes, thanks. So, let me just give some high-level comments about the CET1 trajectory and so on. So, as you know, we went into the quarter with elevated buffers, knowing that we would have denominator growth as a result of the adoption of SA-CCR. And so, of course, that happened. And we would have expected roughly to be 12.5 right in the middle of the range this quarter. Of course, it was an unusual quarter in a number of ways. And so, we saw RWA inflation from market risk, which we've talked about and the AOCI drawdown and a number of other slightly smaller factors producing the 11.9%. From where we sit here, to your point, a number of these items are, in fact, going to bleed back in relatively quickly, some faster than others. So, we would expect a significant portion of the RWA inflation to bleed out, obviously, to decay out. The AOCI drawdown will obviously come back over time. And probably most importantly, to the prior question, the higher rate outlook is improving the revenue outlook, which will, of course, accrete to capital. So then, if you line that up against the sort of rising minimums, of course, we have the increase in the G-SIB requirement in the first quarter of '23 coming in. And then, there's a question of SCB, where we don't know, obviously, but given the countercyclical nature of the stress and the fact that the unemployment launch point is a lot lower and that the unemployment rate is floored in the Fed scenario, you might expect SCB to be a little bit higher when it's published in June, effective in the fourth quarter. But that gives us time to make any adjustments that we need to make. So, I guess, to summarize, when we put all this together, between improved income generation, some of the denominator to KFX and the various levers that we have available to pull across the dimension of time as soon information comes into play, we really feel quite good about our capital position from here and the trajectory as we look forward and minimums evolve. And just a follow-up there, too. Is there anything you need to consider structurally in terms of like adding preferreds to help bridge the gap, or is it just going to be enough to organically build back with possibly just utilizing less buyback to allow things to just grow back? Yes. I think, the -- I guess, in general, we haven't wanted to say a lot publicly about our preferred actions. As you know, some of these instruments are callable. And we have choices to make about whether or not we call them to adjust to different situations. So I think that's an example of the types of levers that we have available to pull as the environment evolves. But from where we sit today with the numbers that I'm looking at, we have a pretty clean trajectory to get to where we want to be. The next one is coming from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. I had a question for Jamie. In your annual letter, you mentioned how you expect to achieve double-digit market share over time in payments. And what I wanted to understand is if you could unpack that a little bit because when I look at payments, you've got a lot of different sleeves. For example, in consumer credit card, you're at 20%, 25%. In treasury, I think you're at 7%. So, could you give us a sense as to where you think you are in this total payments category you're talking about, what you're expecting in terms of drivers to get to double digit and what kind of time frame you're thinking about there? Thanks. Yes. So yes, Betsy, so that number, the double-digit relating just to Wholesale Payments, not to consumer payments, which obviously, we already have a fairly significant share. And we've gone from 4.5% to something a little bit north of 7% over the last five years. And we're just building out. And I gave some examples and I’d give a lot and then you have Investor Day coming up, we're building all the things we need, real-time payments, certain blockchain-type things. While it's a couple of acquisitions, they're building out our Wholesale capabilities to do a far better job for clients globally around the world and supported by what I'd say very good cyber and risk controls, which clients really need too, by the way. So, it's kind of across the board. It's nothing mystical about it, but it's an area we want to win in. Okay. And getting to double digits is over the same kind of time frame with the same pace going from 4 to 7, or do you think you can accelerate that? Because I see what... I wasn't meaning to put a time frame on it, but I would say five years. You'll get more update on this at Investor Day. Okay. And then, just a follow-up here is on the NII outlook, where you indicated the curve suggests the plus side and is it a couple of billion. And I guess the question I have is historically, you've been looking to reinvest that benefit from rising rates. You did that last cycle as well. What I hear -- what I'm hearing is that maybe you don't want to size it for us right now today because you plan on investing it and explaining that at Investor Day. Is that a fair takeaway? No, no, no. We don't look at that way like we're reinvesting NII. We -- the investing stuff, we look at all the time we're investing, and we're investing a lot of money for the future kind of across the board. But that's not why you're saying... I mean, I think fundamentally, we have had confidence in delivering our 17% ROTCE through the cycle. We talked a little bit over the last couple of quarters about at the time, some short-term headwinds to that, mostly as a function of the rate environment and a couple of other things. The investment plan is a strategic plan that recognizes that sort of confidence in the 17%. The fact that that moment may be getting pulled forward as a result of the Fed's reaction to the economy has no impact on how we think about spending. The next question is coming from Steve Chubak from Wolfe Research. So, I wanted to start off with a question on QT. In the past, you've spoken about the linkage between Fed balance sheet reduction and deposit outflow expectation for yourselves in the industry. And with the Fed just outlining a more aggressive glide path per balance sheet reduction, how should we be thinking about deposit outflow risk? Any views on how betas may differ versus last cycle, given a more aggressive pace of Fed timing? Hey Steve, so this is a fun question. So, let's nerd out a little bit. I'm sure Jamie will jump in. So look, I think we've talked a little bit about what happened in the prior cycle, right? So, you had QE, and then you had big expansion in bank deposits, system-wide expansion. And at the tail end of that cycle, you had RRP come in, and then RRP has gotten sort of quite big as QE finished. And so now, as you look at potentially kind of running that whole thing in reverse, you might actually expect that the first thing that would happen is that RRP would get drained and only later would bank deposits start to shrink. But I think you correctly point out some of the nuances in the Fed minutes. And when you sort of combine all the effects together, you realize that there's a lot of interacting forces here and is really, I think, very intelligent people differ on their predictions about what's going to happen here. And just to outline a couple of those. So, it's worth noting for starters that in general, industry-wide loan growth outlook is quite robust, and that should be a tailwind for system-wide deposit growth. So, as you noted, yes, QT will start in May in all likelihood for the minutes headwind. Then, you just have to look at what's going to happen in the front end of the curve, particularly in bills. So, the treasury has to make decisions about weighted average maturity and what makes sense there. There's obviously a little bit of shortage of short-dated collateral in the market right now. So, that might argue for wanting more supply there. The Fed has to make decisions about portfolio management. They talked in the minutes about using bill maturities to fill in gaps and so on and so forth. And so, those things are going to interact in various ways. I think, one thing that's worth noting though is that if you wind up in the state of the world where bank deposits drain sooner than people might have otherwise thought, in all likelihood, that's going to be the lower value non-operating-type deposits. So, in any case, we'll see. But to simplify it for a second, our base case remains modest growth in deposits for us as a company. And just pivoting away for a second from the system to us, from a share perspective, we've taken share in retail deposits, and we feel great about that. And in Wholesale, we've had some nice wins and a nice pipeline of deals there. So, that's the current thinking on that topic. So, the answer is we don't know. Okay? And you guys read economies  reports, but the fact is initially probably won't come out of deposits. Over time, it will come out of Wholesale and then maybe consumer. We're prepared for that. It doesn't actually mean that much to us in the short run. And the beta effectively, we don't expect to be that different than was in the past. There are a lot of pluses and minuses. You can argue a whole bunch of different ways, but the fact it won't be that much different, at least the first 100 basis-point increase. Just one more topic or a follow-up, I should say. Jamie, just in the shareholder letter, you had spoken about how the market is underestimating the number of Fed hikes that might be needed to curb inflation. And what's your expectation around the level of Fed tightening? I know it's difficult to make such predictions, but maybe if you could just help us understand given your own rate outlook, how that's informing how you're managing excess liquidity, given the significant capacity that you have to redeploy some of those proceeds into higher-yielding securities? Yes. So, I think the implied curve now is like 2.5% at the end of the year and maybe 3% at the end of 2023. And look, no one knows. And obviously, everyone does their forecast. I think it's going to be more than that. Okay? I give you a million different reasons why because of inflation and just about deposits. And we've never been through ever QT like this. So, this is a new thing for the world and I think is more substantially important than other people think because the huge change of flows of funds is going to create as people change their investment portfolio. So, we're going to be fine because we're going to certainly help our customers and gain share. So, what does it do for JPMorgan Chase? JPMorgan Chase, we'll be fine. We got plenty of capital, all great margins. We already have the returns we want and all things like that. So, I just -- I would just be cautious. I think what you should expect is volatile markets. Again, that's okay for us. And the Fed -- we think the Fed needs to do, they need to do to try to manage this economy and try to get to a soft landing, if possible. And any appetite to deploy the excess liquidity? No, don't expect that. The next question is coming from Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. I wonder if you could talk through the changes in the macro assumptions to capture that downside risk in CECL assumptions, just because what I want to get to is where we came from, where we're at now and then we can impose our thoughts on each quarter. Yes. I don't want to spend a lot of time on CECL. I think it's a complete waste of time. Basically, all we said is the chance of an adverse or severe adverse event is 10% higher than it was before. That's all we did, very basic. And that led to a big... It really is that... And we don't know, and it's a guess. It's probability weighted, hypothetical, multiyear scenarios that -- we do the best we can, but to spend a lot of time on earnings calls about CECL swings is a waste of time. It's got nothing to do with the underlying business. Charge-offs are extraordinarily good, as a matter of fact, way better than they should be. I mean, middle market, 1 basis point, credit card 1.5. We would have told you in the past that the best it'll ever be is 2.5. So, credit is very good. That will get worse. NII is going to get much better. Things are going to normalize. We're still earning 16% or 17% on tangible equity. And obviously, you have -- yes. The 10% is what I wanted because your guess is better than my guess. So, I appreciate that. I don't -- Glenn, with all due respect, I do not believe it is. Okay. So, I think you might have just answered it, but I want to make sure I ask it explicitly. The follow-up I have on credit, and I know it's in much better shape, and it depends on the go forward. But are you seeing any stresses in the levered parts of the debt markets, meaning leveraged loan, high-yield, CLO, private credit, anything in there that makes you like turn a side eye? Just spread widening, a little bit less liquidity. That doesn't sound so bad. And... I mean, I think, look, we -- no one likes to be complacent about this type of stuff. And obviously, in this environment, everyone's looking very closely everywhere for any risks and trying to see around the corner. But as of right now, we're really not seeing anything of concern in the kind of spot metrics, so to speak. Maybe the last quickie on credit is just with everybody having a job and there's wage inflation and excess cash, are there any buckets of income that you're seeing early stage delinquencies picking up? In short, no. It is an interesting question as you look across our customer base, particularly in card and you sort of -- that heavily debated question of real income growth and gas prices and what's that doing to consumer balance sheets. And so, we're watching that, especially in the kind of LMI segment of our customer base. But right now, we're not actually seeing anything that gives us reason to worry. The next one is coming from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jeremy, can we follow up on your comments about building up the reserves? I think you said it was $902 million that you guys built up and was due to high inflation and the war in the Ukraine. How much was it due to inflation? And when you made that comment, is it because you're concerned about the lower-end consumer spending more money for fuel and food that might lead to greater delinquencies down the road? And how much was it due to the Ukraine situation? Yes, Glenn (sic) , it's really a lot more general than that. So just to repeat, 900 build, 300 name specific, primarily related to Russia-associated individual names. The other 600 is portfolio level. And as Jamie just said, it simply reflects increasing the probability from a very low probability to a slightly higher probability of a -- you might call it, Volcker-style, Fed-induced recession in response to the current inflationary environment, which obviously is in part driven by commodity price increases, which are in part driven by the war in Ukraine, so. But it's not a super micro portfolio level thing, except to the extent that our models handle that. It's a top-down modification of the probabilistic ways. One of the things I hated when CECL came out is that we spend a lot of time in every call yapping about CECL. I just think it's a huge mistake for all of us to spend too much time on it. Understood. And then, as a follow-up, Jeremy, if we look at the AOCI number that you gave us, and you were very clear about it's going to accrete back into the capital as those securities mature. Two things. Is there anything you can do, assuming if the long end of the curve continues to rise and probably giving you maybe a bigger hit on AOCI as we go forward, is there anything you can do to mitigate that, whether to shrink that -- the available-for-sale portfolio, which looks like it was $313 billion at the end of this period, or do you just have to grow the revenue, as you pointed out, as another way of growing your capital? Yes. I mean, I think that, obviously, we always try to grow revenue sort of independently of anything else. I think the large point here is, yes, there are some things that can be done to mitigate this. But the big picture is that the central case path is one that gets us to where we want to be when we need to be there in terms of CET1 and leverage. And if things don't play out as along the lines of the central case, we have tools and levers available to adjust across a range of dimensions, so. The next one is coming from Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Hi. I have a question for both, Jeremy and Jamie. Jeremy, I guess the SLR 5.2% close to the minimum, you explained that. But since quarter end, AOCI probably has gotten worse. And I'm guessing your SLR might be very even close to that minimum. So, I understand your central case, it's fine. Your outlook is good. But at what point do you say you stop buybacks, or do you think you'll buy back maybe half of the $30 billion authorization, or does JPMorgan even put on asset caps, given just the amazing asset growth over the last three months? So, that's my question for Jeremy. But the bigger picture is for you, Jamie, your CEO letter. The takeaway was in the eye of the beholder, like Jamie is really worried about a recession this year. Now he's not. So, the first question certainly ties into the second. So Jeremy, plan for buybacks, stopping at asset cap? And then, Jamie, your view of the broader economies and that feeds into your expectations for capital growth. Thank you. Okay, Mike. So, let me take this capital one. So first, let's not talk about asset caps. That's just not a meaningful thing. I think that's a distraction, and the terminology is unhelpful. Then, in terms of the leverage ratio, just remember that the denominator of that number is so big that it actually takes like pretty big moves to move the ratio. So, 5.20 is actually still pretty far away from 5%. And of course, there are relatively easy to use tools to address that as well as was alluded to earlier. In addition, I do think it's worth just reminding everyone of how the ERI restrictions work now relative to how they were at the beginning of the crisis. Just briefly, just to remember that based on the redefinition, if you drop into the regulatory buffer zone, you're subject to a 60% restriction, which based on our recent historical net income generation still gives us like ample, ample capacity to pay the dividend and so on. So, it's obviously not part of the plan, but it's just worth remembering that the cliff effects that we had in there at the beginning of the pandemic are no longer there. And then, in terms of buybacks","['Glenn Schorr', 'Ken Usdin', 'John McDonald', 'Betsy Graseck', 'Jamie Dimon', 'Mike Mayo', 'Gerard Cassidy', 'Operator', 'Steve Chubak', 'Jeremy Barnum']"
6,CVX,1,2022,2022-04-29 13:54:07,"Good morning. My name is Katie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. . As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Roderick Green. Please go ahead. Thank you, Katie. Welcome to Chevron's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. I'm Roderick Green, GM of Investor Relations. Our Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth; and CFO, Pierre Breber, are on the call with me. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron's website.  Before we begin, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2.  Now I'll turn it over to Mike. All right. Thanks, Roderick. Before we turn to first quarter results, I'd like to recognize the people of Ukraine. Our hearts go out to those affected by this tragedy, and we hope for a prompt and enduring diplomatic resolution.  The last 2 years have been volatile and unpredictable, driven by the global pandemic and geopolitical conflict, creating strains on economies and markets around the world. Through it all, our objectives have been clear and consistent. And in the first quarter, we continued to make progress, delivering book returns in the mid-teens, investing to grow both our traditional and New Energy businesses and returning even more cash to shareholders while maintaining an industry-leading balance sheet.  Recent events remind us of the importance of energy. Looking forward, I know that Chevron is doing its part, raising this year's Permian production outlook and advancing 2 important renewable fuel transactions: our Bunge JV, which is expected to close shortly; and the Renewable Energy Group acquisition, which is expected to close around midyear.  While the future is uncertain, our actions are not. We're on a path to delivering higher returns and lower carbon and rewarding our stakeholders all along the way.  With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre to discuss our financials. Thanks, Mike. We reported first quarter earnings of $6.3 billion or $3.22 per share. Adjusted earnings were $6.5 billion or $3.36 per share. Included in the current quarter were pension settlement costs totaling $66 million and negative foreign currency effects exceeding $200 million. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of this presentation.  Adjusted ROCE was over 15% and our net debt ratio is below 11%. A third consecutive quarter with free cash flow over $6 billion, enabled us to return $4 billion to shareholders and further pay down debt. In addition, during the quarter, we received over $4 billion in cash, with about 3,000 current and former employees exercise stock options. This quarter's proceeds from option exercises were over 4x the historical annual average of around $1 billion per year.  About 2/3 of the vest adoptions at year-end 2021 and were exercised during the first quarter, lowering the potential future rate of dilution from the outstanding balance. Over time, we expect our share buybacks to more than offset the first quarter dilutive effect.  Adjusted first quarter earnings were up $4.8 billion versus last quarter -- versus last year. Adjusted upstream earnings increased mainly on higher realizations while adjusted downstream earnings increased primarily on higher margins, partially offset by negative timing effects. Compared with last quarter, adjusted earnings were up more than $1.6 billion. Adjusted upstream earnings increased primarily on higher realizations and the absence of certain fourth quarter DD&A charges.  Liftings were lower in part due to lower production in the Gulf of Mexico. Adjusted downstream earnings decreased primarily on timing effects. The All Other segment was down primarily on unfavorable tax items and higher corporate charges. The All Other segment results can vary between quarters, and our full year guidance is unchanged.  First quarter oil equivalent production decreased 2% year-on-year due to the expiration of Rokan in Indonesia, lower production in Thailand as we approach the end of the concession and lower entitlements due to higher prices. Permian growth in the absence of Winter Storm Uri, impacts partially offset and drove U.S. oil and gas production up over 10%.  Now looking ahead. In the second quarter, we expect lower production due to planned turnarounds at Wheatstone and Angola LNG, impacts from CPC pipeline and the expiration of the Area 1 concession in Thailand. At CPC, 2 of the 3 single port moorings are now back in service and TCO has returned to full operations. Downtime associated with the April repairs is estimated to be less than 15% of our second quarter turnaround and downtime guidance.  We anticipate a return of capital between $250 million and $350 million from Angola LNG in the second quarter. This cash is reported through cash from investing and not cash from operations. In the first quarter, Angola LNG returned over $500 million of capital. The differences between affiliate earnings and dividends are not ratable and TCO has not yet declared a dividend in 2022. With higher commodity prices, affiliate dividends are expected to be $1 billion higher than our previous guidance.  We've utilized our NOLs and other U.S. tax attributes and expect to make estimated U.S. federal and state income tax payments in the second quarter. These payments will flow through working capital accounts, just like our first quarter IRS refunded. In the second quarter, we expect to invest $600 million as we close the Bunge joint venture and to repurchase shares at the top of our guidance range.  With that, I'll turn it back to Roderick. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take your questions. . Katie, please open the lines. . Our first question comes from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Mike, I want to start with one for you on Tengiz. There have been a number of events here in the quarter from the social unrest earlier in the quarter to the PC pipeline uncertainty and the moorings issues. So I recognize production seems to be back up and running to normal now. But I'm curious how you think about this in terms of the broader implications of what has been happening on the ground there. And it's a very important asset for Chevron. So what are your latest thoughts? Well, Phil, it's an important asset, not just to our company but to the Republic of Kazakhstan and, frankly, to world energy markets in Europe, in particular. It's a significant supplier at a time when there are concerns about supply security that you're very familiar with. So we're focused on safe and reliable operations, as you would expect, protecting people in the environment and our assets, executing the major project, that's underway. And working with all the stakeholders that are involved in this. So that includes partners, it includes, obviously, the government of Kazakhstan and our customers.  So the risks that I think you're referring to are risks that are present in Kazakhstan and in varying degrees, in other parts of the world as well. And that's part of what we do is manage those risks on the ground each and every day. There are times when the environment feels a bit more benign, but you can't take your eyes off those risks because they can materialize at any point.  So to this point in time, we've been able to make good progress on the project. Some impact really from the weather-related downtime at the loading buoys at lower . But 2 of those are back in service and the third one is slated for repair, which would give us plenty of redundant capacity there. So we continue to stay very focused on every aspect of managing that our people on the ground are empowered to do what it takes and to be very responsive in real time. And I'm incredibly proud of the work that they've done in a very challenging environment. Understood. I appreciate your thoughts. My second question would be for Pierre on cash flows or cash balances. The quarter did come in a bit lower than expected on cash flows, and I think you highlighted some timing factors. But you did get a bunch of cash from the stock vesting. So cash balances are up quite significantly. So I was wondering, I don't know if there's anything else to highlight on the moving pieces of the cash flow. But even at strip prices with your buybacks, it seems like cash balances will keep going up. So just what are your latest thoughts on managing the cash from here? Thanks, Phil. First, let me just talk about cash in the quarter. Cash in the quarter was very strong. As I pointed out, our dividends from affiliates are not ratable. And particularly from TCO, which historically has paid dividends in the fourth quarter, we increased our guidance on expected dividends, but they were light in the first quarter. So yes, that's timing. I also pointed out that Angola LNG returned $500 million of capital. That's essentially operating cash. That's a function of operating an LNG facility and selling it into the European gas markets at TTF prices.  However, adjusted to the accounting rules, it's flowing through cash from investing and not cash from ops. But for all intents and purposes, it is operating cash flow. And at some point in time in the future, it might revert back to that depending on the retained earnings in that affiliate. Another item I did not mention is that it's a typical item that happens in the first quarter. We pay out our long-term incentive compensation, which a portion of that is in the form of restricted stock and performance shares.  That is, again, happens annually, but with a higher stock price, that was a higher payment than in previous years. That does not flow through working capital. That comes out of a long-term liability account. And then as I mentioned, we expect to make estimated tax payments next quarter, but that will flow through working capital in many of analysts look at our cash flow ex working capital. But our IRS refund also went through working capital that we had guided to in the first quarter.  In terms of our cash balances, we're running a little bit high on our cash balance. That's why we refer to net debt, but we have a couple of cash items coming up. We expect to close REG around midyear. That's $3 billion. And we have an offering up right now to do a make whole call on about $3 billion of bonds. These are bonds that are economic to call back. And then on the buybacks, I mean, we just increased our buyback guidance at our Investor Day back in March to $5 billion to $10 billion W.e were at $5 billion rate here in the first quarter. We're doubling it now to the top of the range of $10 billion, and we'll just see where the environment goes from here.  We are not setting -- we are setting the buyback at a rate that we can maintain across the commodity cycle. We could have a higher buyback rate this quarter or next quarter, but the goal is not to maximize the buyback rate in any individual quarter. It's to set it at a level that we can maintain when the cycle turns. And therefore, we can rebalance our net debt ratio closer to our mid-cycle guidance. We'll take our next question from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley. So the first one I wanted to ask is just on the Permian results and guidance increase. I was wondering if you could talk through in a bit more detail some of the drivers there. Are you adding activity? Is it better performance on the activity you had already budgeted for? Is it nonoperated? Just walk through some of the drivers there and how you're thinking about that. Yes, Devin, we did have a strong first quarter and a couple of big things to bear in mind there. As we slowed things down in 2020 when demand contracted due to the pandemic, what happened is we ended up with an inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells that grew beyond what would be kind of a normal run rate for our rig fleet. And so we've been working through that and we're back down now to what you could think of as a more normal factory model. We always want to have docks out in front of the completion crews but that had grown to a larger than normal rate.  So as we've caught that up, that's pretty efficient. It's the first place you turn as you see the cycle turn is completing those wells to get that production online, and we'll be moving into more of a factory model. So it will level out a little bit versus what might feel like a little bit of a surge. We also get some nonratable joint venture bookings that show up. And so both of those contributed to a very strong first quarter.  And of course, by the time you look at how that would roll through in the continued activity for the rest of this year, it's pretty clear that we'll end up higher than the initial guidance that we had put out. So -- but we haven't stepped up our program. We haven't stepped up a number of rigs. We haven't stepped up spending. It's all really a function of getting the machine running again. And then underneath that, there's ongoing efficiency improvements that we continue to see. Got it. That's very helpful. And my second question is on your global gas and LNG portfolio. And I was wondering if you could just give us an update on how you're looking at some of the medium and longer-term opportunities there given what's going on in markets. And specifically, I'm thinking about Eastern Med and that gas position. And then also whether or not integration into some type of LNG facility in the U.S. might make sense for some of your production growth there as well? Sure. So LNG is on everybody's mind these days. It's important to meeting Europe's needs. It's important to delivering a lower carbon energy system globally, and we see this strong market here in the near term. Eastern Med is a wonderful asset. I was just over there 2 weeks ago. I visited the Leviathan platform, we spent a lot of time with our people in the business there. And they've recently completed a project to increase infrastructure access to regional markets and we're actually flowing more gas into Egypt as a result of that.  We're looking at a number of other opportunities to further increased production because the resource there is quite prolific. And that includes further coal-to-gas switching in Israel for the regional supply into neighboring countries, potential power generation for power distribution through the region, floating LNG, potentially using oilage and other LNG facilities in the region, a number of different commercial options that are being evaluated and worked.  So more to come as those mature, but it's an area of high priority for us because the market demand for it. When you look at the U.S., clearly, we've got a lot of gas production here that largely prices at Henry Hub today. And there are these projects that are in the process for LNG export facilities. We've had discussions with a number of those developers, nothing to say more than we've had discussions at this point.  But that's part of our LNG portfolio that we've been very focused on the Pacific Basin historically. And as the Atlantic Basin markets now look a little bit different as we flow gas from our West African assets into the Atlantic Basin, it may make sense for us to have some U.S. supply as well. So we'll advise you as we advance anything there. We'll take our next question from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Mike, I just love your perspective on the oil macro. You always have a good read on it. It strikes us that inventories for product and oil are very tight right now. You've got jet fuel recovering over the summer. We'll see what happens in China. Shale has an inelastic supply response. So how does this ultimately resolve itself in the near term? Do you ultimately need to solve or demand destruction through crack or flat price of oil? Or is there something that we're missing? No, Neil. I mean you're putting your finger on all the levers. If you step back from it, supply always responds more slowly than demands does. And in normal times, which we have not been in for the last couple of years, both of them kind of gradually move in relative sympathy with one another. You've got storage out there that can buffer any near-term imbalances. I'm repeating what you all know. But in 2020, we saw a contraction unlike anything I've seen in my lifetime. And we had to really constrain activity. There was no sense producing more oil when the world needed a lot less.  And it wasn't clear at the time how long that might last and how deep it would be. And so the entire industry, every segment of the industry responded to that. And then as we've come out of the pandemic, demand growth has surged. And as you say, we haven't seen it all come back yet. Air travel, while it's -- domestic air travel in the U.S. is pretty strong, international air travel still has a ways to go to recover to pre-pandemic levels.  And then China and other parts of the world are still in various stages of lockdown at various points in time. And so we haven't seen a full recovery of demand there. So even with that, demand has now responded more quickly than supply can match it. And then you overlay a host of other issues, right? The independent E&Ps feeling more of an obligation to return cash to their shareholders. Some of the big integrated companies have reprioritized new energy versus traditional energy and have indicated they intend to shrink rather than grow their oil and gas production.  And then the NOCs going around the world, everybody has got a little bit of a different situation. So it's a market that is not stable. It's not an equilibrium. Right now, as you say, inventories are quite low. Demand is still strong, and economies to this point seem to be handling it. At some point, particularly if prices were to move higher, I do think it starts to be a bigger drag on the economy than what we've seen to this point.  But there's a lot of attention in this market and the supply response is coming. We're up 10% in the U.S. year-on-year. We're working on the big project in Kazakhstan, which will start up over the next couple of years. And others around the world have got things that they're doing as well. But it just comes in at a different pace than the demand has moved. And I think we're in a market that's tight right now, that has a lot of uncertainty and I think that is not likely to resolve itself in the near term, the uncertainty. Things like the SPR release in the near term can do a certain amount to call those markets. But over time, it's a cyclical business. There's a lot of resource out there that can be produced at prices lower than we see today.  And one of the lessons is history is just as the bad times don't last forever, neither do the times when prices are strong, and so we can't start to believe they'll always be like this. But I think in the relative short term here, the tensions that you referred to are likely to remain. It's a great perspective, Mike. Another big picture question is, if you think about 20 years ago at the beginning of the last super cycle, you had very similar, very large multiple arbitrages between the super majors and even large independents and some of the majors. And one could look at your multiple on consensus and say you trade a premium relative to a lot of the global majors. Do you think there's value in mega M&A in the space? And do you see yourself as a logical consolidator, given that M&A is such a core competency and it worked out incredibly well for you 20 years ago with Texaco? Yes. We're always looking at these things, Neil. I think history would suggest that deals done in an upcycle or near the top of the cycle don't necessarily look as well in hindsight as deals that were done in a different part of the cycle. 20 years ago, when there was a number of transactions that you referred to, we were coming out of oil prices in the teens or the '20s. And so consolidation made sense.  There were a lot of synergies to be harvested as you put some of these companies together. I think the entire industry is more efficient today than it was then certainly large companies, which you refer to kind of large-scale M&A. And so I think the synergy opportunities, while no doubt there would be some, they may not be of the same magnitude that they were 20 years ago. We've all used technology and other things to improve the efficiency of our operations.  So I never say never, but I don't know that just because we're trading at a relatively strong multiple right now that, that should lead you to believe that it means we're more likely to do something that our track record of discipline would suggest. We'll take our next question from Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Our first question, maybe we just hit back on cash returns. The buyback for 2Q annualized again, is at the top of your range. And Pierre, I think you reiterated on Phil's question that buybacks are intended to be through the cycle. Can you just maybe provide a little bit of commentary on how you're viewing the buyback in relation to mid-cycle cash flow? Thanks, Jeanine. The buyback rate of $10 billion is a company record, and previous highest buyback rate was back in 2008. And as you say, we want to maintain it across the commodity cycle. So we're very in tune with what our mid-cycle cash flow capabilities are. We showed at our Investor Day low case of $50 Brent and show that we can maintain the buyback for multiple years, even though $50 is notionally right around the breakeven for covering both our dividend and our capital. And then, of course, we showed the high case of $75 where buybacks were, in fact, higher than the current $10 billion guidance.  And we could buy back at that point in time, it was more than 25% of the company, it's a little bit less based on the current stock price. So that's exactly how we're thinking about it. To Neil's question and the macro, it was just 2 years ago today on this earnings call, that Chevron was the only company to show a 2-year stress test at $30 Brent. And that was a real stress test. And we showed that we could maintain the dividend, invest in the business for long-term value. We certainly reduced some short-cycle capital.  And yes, we would take on some debt, but we'd have a debt ratio that would still be very manageable. And in fact, would be not far from where many of our competitors were entering the COVID crisis. So as Mike says, we're mindful of the cycles that are in our business, we have to plan and manage for them. Again, we could have -- we can afford a much bigger buyback program next quarter. We don't -- you know, Jeanine, that a net debt ratio under 11% is not what we're targeting. I mean that's just how the math works.  We grew our dividend 6% earlier this year. Our dividend is up nearly 20% since COVID, while many in the industry cut their dividends during the last couple of years. Our investment -- organic investment is up more than 30% versus last year. When you include our announced acquisitions, total investment is up 50%. So clearly, we're investing, as Mike has said, to grow both our traditional new energy businesses.  And we paid down debt, and we've been increasing our buyback as we've seen the strength of this upcycle and the likely duration of it increase, but the cycle will turn and we'll continue to do buybacks. And so we want to set the buyback at a rate that we can manage it, not only at our mid-cycle cash flow generation capability, but even when it goes below that. Again, we're going to -- there's going to be a time where we're going to be buying back shares, and we'll be doing it on the balance sheet because we want to relever back closer to that 20% to 25% net debt ratio range that I've talked about. Okay. Great. Very helpful. Maybe if we just can move back to the assets on the Permian. Permian for you guys is firing on all cylinders, clearly have a big asset there with huge long-term value. One of the things that has been talked about a bunch recently is just FT on the gas side and how you kind of see that evolving. Just wondering how Chevron is looking at that for your long-term plans. Yes, Jeanine, we -- I'm glad you talked about long-term plans because we've had a long-term Permian plan. And interestingly, notwithstanding one of the most volatile 2-year periods we've seen, our production profile doesn't look that different than it did just a couple of years ago in terms of where we're headed. And of course, that drives everything from contracting for rigs and completion services to takeaway capacity for oil and gas liquids and gas. We've got sufficient takeaway capacity for our production through the middle of this decade.  And as we look forward, we're working on what it takes beyond that period of time. So we don't flare in the Permian. And so we've got to be sure we've got gas takeaway or we're not going to produce oil. And so it's a high priority for our midstream team. But we don't see pinch points anytime soon, and we continue to be a very attractive shipper for the people that we do business with because we're predictable. We've got a strong track record of continuing to deliver the growth that we have indicated. We got a strong balance sheet and all those things mean that people like to do business with us. So we feel pretty good about that for the next few years. We'll take our question from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Two questions, please. First on inflation. Pierre, just curious, I mean for your CapEx for the next, say, 2 or 3 years, do you have a percentage you can share? What percent of your CapEx is in pretty much fixed price contracts, so don't subject much to inflation and what percent is really quite vulnerable to inflation? And also when we're looking at your CapEx for this year, the Bunge JV $600 million investment, is that included in your original budget or that this will be in addition to your original budget? That's the first question.  The second question maybe is for Mike, that with the much sharply higher commodity prices, when you have discussion and negotiation with the NOC, the host government, is there a change in the attitude on that it become more difficult for you to get better terms? Or that this is happening too quick and so you haven't really seen any change in the way how you conduct the discussion with your counterpart in the national companies or the host government? I'll start... Pierre, do you want to start on -- yes, go ahead. Yes, I'll start on the first question. There are several parts to it. So first, the Bunge joint venture, anything that is an acquisition inorganic is not included in our $15.3 billion budget that we shared back in December. So I think we cited that, in fact, in that press release that Bunge would be in addition. And then the other potential inorganic, there was a little bit of inorganic in the first quarter that included an investment in Carbon Clean, a technology company. REG also will not be included.  You won't see REG though, even in our total capital, our total C&E because it's a company acquisition. Let me just talk about cost inflation a little bit. We are seeing more cost pressure in the Permian. It's manageable. But if we go outside the U.S. seeing hardly any or much more modest increases, and none of that is changing our $15.3 billion CapEx budget that we've talked about. I'll remind everyone that the Permian is 20% of our capital budget. So it gets a lot of attention.  But again, 80% of it is not -- or outside the U.S. is not seeing much cost pressure at all. In the Permian, as Mike said, we plan our business. So we have all the equipment and services to execute our plan. And we've seen a little bit more than we had budgeted, but we can offset some of that with efficiencies in the Permian and with reductions elsewhere in the portfolio. Our focus is turning to 2023 and securing all the equipment and services that we'll need to execute that plan. But we'll share the details as we update our annual budget, which we do every December.  In general, Paul, you can think that we contract 30% to 40% of our total supplies each year. So that every 2 to 3 years on a rotational basis, it can vary, it depends by location. But we don't -- notionally, we are going to be exposed to some of these higher prices as we move into future years. Again, we've been able to manage this year very well depending on -- due to how we contracted previously.  Our $15 billion to $17 billion capital guidance, which goes on for 5 years, kind of assumes mid-cycle conditions. So it has the ability to absorb some of these cost increases that are transient. And so we'll execute within that. We have Tengiz coming off, which will open up more room in that capital guidance. And again, we'll share all the details when we release our capital budget in December.  But the bottom line is we're seeing modest increase. As we said, overall, our capital budget had just a few low single digits of COGS inflation for this year, a little bit more than that in the Permian. It's all very manageable, and we're working hard to secure contracts for future years activity. Mike? Okay. Paul, your second question was on discussions with host governments on concessions and how that may be affected by the price environment. I would tell you that right now, we're pretty early into this price upcycle. And I'm not sure that I can say we've seen a lot of change as people are really adjusting to the environment we're in. But on the broader issue of concession extensions, look, we've got to find these opportunities and negotiations that create value for the company and for the host country. And so you really have to look at it through the lens of both.  We had long histories in both Indonesia and Thailand. I would have liked to extend those concessions that are rolling off last year and this year, but we couldn't find an outcome that satisfied the host governments expectations and that would compete for capital within our portfolio, which has got a lot of alternatives. The flip side of that is Angola, where we last year extended our Block 0 concession from 2030 out to 2050.  And that's a partnership that started more than 60 years ago. And there was a lot of common ground there on contributing to reliable and cleaner supply for Angola, reducing greenhouse gas emissions there and finding a way to do that on terms that will attract capital within our portfolio.  So we approach each one of these things, looking for value for our shareholders and to provide a proposition for other stakeholders that they find acceptable. Sometimes we can achieve that. Other times, we can't. So more to follow probably in terms of -- if this turns out to be a long upcycle, how that may change those dynamics. But I think the fundamental approach that we take is unlikely to change. We'll take our next question from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Yes. If we could maybe talk a little bit about some of the bigger projects, thinking about your answer earlier, Mike, on some of the macro items and under investment. I know you have some things in the Gulf of Mexico. You've obviously got an extensive LNG footprint globally. How do you think over the next couple of years blending in your kind of known deepwater projects and then the possibility of doing something again on the LNG front? Yes. So we've got a nice set of projects under development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Jack/St. Malo has a multiphase pumping project that will start up this year. Next year, we'll hit the first waterflood injection on St. Malo and some additional development drilling there. Big Foot, which is on production right now. We've got ongoing development drilling and water injection soon to follow. Mad Dog 2 is slated for first oil this year.  We've got Anchor, which is expected to have first oil in 2024. Whale also expecting to have first oil in 2024. We just sanctioned Ballymore, which we'll have first oil in 2025. So there are -- there's a queue of these things that is rolling through. And what's a little bit different than in t","['Roger Read', 'Devin McDermott', 'Jeanine Wai', 'Philip Gresh', 'Pierre Breber', 'Roderick Green', 'Michael Wirth', 'Operator', 'Neil Mehta', 'Paul Cheng']"
7,KO,1,2022,2022-04-25 12:14:02,"At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to The Coca-Cola Company's First Quarter Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors, and therefore, questions from the media will not be addressed. Media participants should contact Coca-Cola's Media Relations department if they have any questions. I would now like to introduce Mr. Tim Leveridge, Vice President of IR and FP&A. Mr. Leveridge, you may now begin. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm here with James Quincey, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Murphy, our Chief Financial Officer. Note that we’ve posted schedules under Financial Information in the Investors section of our company website at www.coca-colacompany.com. These schedules reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to by our senior executives during this morning's discussion to our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. You can also find schedules in the same section of our website that provide an analysis of our gross and operating margins. In addition, this call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives, which should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's periodic SEC reports. Following prepared remarks this morning, we'll turn the call over for questions. Please limit yourself to one question. If you have more than one, please ask your most pressing one first and then reenter the queue. Now I'll turn the call over to James. Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. First and foremost, on behalf of our company and our entire system, I'd like to share our deepest sympathies to all those who have been affected by what's happening in Ukraine. The safety of our people and their families continues to be our top priority. And as we highlighted in our release this morning, we are taking actions to provide that support. Now this morning, I'll discuss how we drove strong results in the quarter and that we are reiterating our guidance even in the face of incremental challenges. Then John will discuss the financial details of the quarter and how our work has prepared us for whatever may be around the corner. We all know that much has happened in the world since we last talked with you in February, leading, for sure, to an operating environment that is fast changing and increasingly complex. However, we remain confident about the future and are well equipped to manage external factors worldwide through our strengthened leadership position with the right portfolio, the right strategy and the right execution in the marketplace. After a promising start to the year, the operating environment soon changed with very significant geopolitical conflict, a resurgence of COVID in various places, record-high inflation and continued challenges on the supply chain front. Nonetheless, we've consistently sustained our momentum from last year, moving with agility as conditions changed to generate strong top and bottom line growth in the quarter. We delivered 8% unit case volume growth, primarily driven by strong recovery in away-from-home channels and continued growth in our home channels. Volume growth was strong across all operating segments, driven by marketing investments and aided by an increase in consumer mobility as the impact of the pandemic abated in most regions. Our enhanced capabilities helped us gain value share overall in both at-home and away-from-home channels globally and across most of our geographic operating segments, a clear indicator of the power of our new approach. Amidst the dynamic macro conditions and an inflationary cost backdrop, we focused on delivering growth. The key competitive edge of The Coca-Cola system continues to be the ability to deliver value for our consumers and our customers in any environment. Our accelerated agenda in marketing and innovation is tying our beverages to daily consumption occasions, adding and creating value for our brands. Additionally, we continue to work with our bottling partners to expand package offerings and strengthen distribution to capture growth opportunities, using all the available revenue growth management levers, including price, to win in the marketplace. These scaled global initiatives are coming to life at a local level all around the world. So let's start with Asia Pacific. In India, we drove excellence in integrated execution as consumer mobility improved across channels by stepping up product availability, adding approximately 240,000 outlets and over 50,000 coolers. We also continue to build relevance through innovation by launching Maaza Aam Panna to leverage our equity in Mango and Fanta Apple to expand our footprint in the fast-growing fruit-flavored sparkling subcategory. Japan is emerging from its extended state of emergency, and we've increased our consumer base and driven market share gains in key categories. The Coke ON app reached 35 million app downloads, continuing the direct engagement with consumers to create and capture value. We also continued our focus on ESG initiatives with 100% recycled PET bottles now available in Japan for 5 key brands, including Coke and Georgia Coffee. In China, a strong start in January, led by an excellent Chinese New Year brand activation with Coke, was followed by strict COVID lockdowns, and this resulted in reduced consumer mobility. Momentum reversed in February and March and led to a decline in unit case volume during the quarter. We're moving fast to focus on core SKUs and ensure product availability. We're adapting how we engage with consumers depending upon local market conditions, and we're working in close collaboration with our bottling partners to focus on execution basics like increasing multipack availability and maximizing share of visible inventory in channels and regions that are open. In ASEAN and South Pacific, we gained share in key countries and across most categories, while consumer mobility was mixed and supply chain headwinds remained. Growth was led by Trademark Coke and sparkling flavors, driven by strong end-to-end execution of the , Sprite Heat Happens and the Fanta Colorful People brand campaigns. In EMEA, notwithstanding the conflict in Ukraine and an uptick in inflation, we delivered a strong performance in Europe in the quarter. The continued rollout of new and improved Coca-Cola Zero Sugar across key markets helped drive 5 percentage points of sparkling single-serve mix growth, which is ahead of pre-pandemic levels. Topo Chico Hard Seltzer is closing the gap with the #1 hard seltzer brand in Europe, and the eB2B business with myccep.com accounted for low double-digit contribution to total revenue. We are keeping a close watch on the spillover reflex of the conflict in Ukraine on the health of the consumer, and we remain ready to pivot and adapt. In Africa, macroeconomic recovery is underway, although conditions remain challenging due to inflationary pressure. In South Africa, we accelerated refillable PET expansion and the execution of in-store sampling to retain consumers. We are connecting with our existing customers in the digital space and have surpassed 65,000 outlets on the Wabi eB2B platform, significantly ahead of plan. Despite macro volatility and intense inflation in the region, Eurasia and Middle East drove top line growth through a strong suite of marketing programs across categories, led by sparkling and ready-to-drink tea. In Turkey, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar became the #2 immediate consumption player in value share behind brand Coke. In Pakistan, Coke Studio, a platform that unites diverse cultures through the power of music, drove social engagement that reached an all-time high in terms of impressions and viewings. In North America, we are seeing more inflation and continue to navigate supply chain dynamics. We're closely monitoring further pressure in some inputs such as high fructose corn syrup, PET and metals, along with wages and transportation as they impact us as well as our bottling partners. Despite these challenges, we continue to gain share in both at-home and away-from-home channels and across most categories. The strong rollout of Real Magic platform and the successful launch of Coke Starlight resulted in Coke Trademark being the fastest-growing trademark in measured retail, driving household penetration up a full point. Powerade posed its power launch during NCAA March Madness, generating more than 1 billion impressions. We also continue to learn from the returnable glass-bottled pilot that has been implemented in the Southwest. In Latin America, we delivered strong performance despite challenging macro conditions, and the investments we made to sustain momentum are paying off. We remain focused on integrated execution and drove revenue growth faster than transaction growth, both of which grew faster than unit case volume growth. Our work to strengthen the traditional trade is paying off as the channel showed the best underlying performance across all channels. The Prospera loyalty program added nearly 50,000 retailers in the quarter while continuing to advance our customer-focused digital expansion. Notably, we have digitized nearly 2 million customers in the region, and we are leveraging the strong system alignment with our bottling partners and are continuing to execute for growth. Within Global Ventures, despite an inflationary backdrop in the UK, Costa continued to recover driven by retail and strong like-for-like sales with Costa Express. In China, while retail sales were impacted by store closures due to the pandemic, Costa ready-to-drink coffee sustained its #2 position and continue to innovate with Costa chart. Finally, our Bottling Investments Group delivered strong Q1 performance, driven by the expansion of affordable immediate consumption entry packs in key markets, and this resulted in share gains in sparkling. We also continue to make progress towards optimizing trade promotions and cost to serve in our key markets and raise the bar on operational excellence. Clearly, the operating environment has proven to be more challenging, but we're pleased with the results we delivered in the first quarter. We continue to believe the recovery in 2022 will be asynchronous. We anticipate many new chapters and challenges, including, but not limited to, ongoing geopolitical conflict; uncertain consumer sentiment amidst the increasingly inflationary environment, accelerated cost pressures and ongoing supply challenges; and of course, continued evolution of pandemic. That said, the changes we have made during the pandemic have left us better positioned than ever to capture growth, increasing our confidence in the future. The multiple levers of revenue growth management have never been more important, and our investments in building this capability over the past few years are giving us a clear advantage. Further actions on pricing will depend on the consumer and inflationary environment as the year progresses, but we will continue to rely on a mix of price, package differentiation and ever-sharper promotional strategies. Through integrated RGM and execution capabilities, we adapt to local market conditions and give consumers what they want, where they want it and at the right price. By extending package offerings to keep transaction driving price points in play, we retain consumers through affordability while also driving premiumization with innovation and targeted pricing. For example, in Latin America, we are continuing the expansion of refillables to sparkling flavors and juices, and this remains a compelling consumer proposition to address the need for affordability. In North America, we're maximizing value by initiatives like the one expanding the availability of mini cans for consumption across occasions such as breaks and meals and by offering 6 packs, 10 packs and 30 packs, driving an approximate 45% increase in retail dollars in measured channels and their near-20% increase in total distribution points. Our networked organization structure extends to our system. Our bottling partners complement our progress against our capabilities by continuing to invest in the marketplace, and they help put our purpose into action. We have strong partners with highly capable and experienced leadership, and we continue to build and foster our business and each in our relationship that drive system health and long-term growth opportunities. With our purpose to refresh the world to make a difference, we continue to focus our ESG work on issues where we can have a measurable positive impact on communities as well as create opportunities for our business to grow. We release our fourth combined business and ESG report tomorrow, an integrated approach to reporting that is a strong demonstration of how sustainability is linked to our business, builds resilience and demonstrates transparency. We have a long history of assuring select sustainability metrics while also providing key public disclosures against the TCFD recommendations as well as other reporting frameworks such as SASB, GRI and the UN Global Compact. In the report, we highlight how we and our bottling partners are driving business growth through our interconnected ESG goals and how we continue to seek an exponentially greater impact by fostering collective action, partnering across industry, government and society to address shared challenges. In conclusion, while there is no doubt the world is more uncertain and the operating environment remains highly dynamic, our strategy remains the same: to execute for sustainable growth through strengthened capabilities in innovation, marketing, RGM and execution. Now I'll turn the call over to John. Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll highlight our first quarter performance and discuss our full year 2022 earnings guidance; then I'll provide commentary on the overall operating environment and how our organization is navigating effectively to drive results. Let me first start by saying how pleased we are with the results in the first quarter. We delivered strong organic revenue growth of 18%; unit cases grew 8%, with strong growth across all operating segments; concentrate sales were ahead of unit cases by 3 points in the quarter, primarily due to the timing of shipments in Latin America and EMEA. Our price/mix of 7% was driven by strategic pricing, revenue growth management initiatives, further improvement in away-from-home channels in most markets and positive segment mix. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was down approximately 90 basis points versus the prior year, primarily due to the impact of 2 items: one, consolidating the BODYARMOR; and two, currency headwinds. Underlying gross margin expanded despite continued pressure from commodity costs, due to pricing actions in the market and a benefit from the timing of concentrate shipments. We continue to prioritize consumer-facing marketing to maximize returns while driving productivity in our operating costs leading to leverage in the P&L. Comparable operating margin expanded by approximately 50 basis points despite acquisition and currency headwinds. First quarter comparable EPS of $0.64 grew 16% year-over-year. This was driven by strong top line growth which benefited from the timing of concentrate shipments and operating margin improvements, partially offset by currency and cost headwinds. On the cash flow front, we delivered free cash flow of approximately $400 million in the first quarter as our strong business performance was more than offset primarily by 2 items: one, cycling the timing of working capital benefits in the prior year; and two, higher 2021 annual incentives paid in the first quarter. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our cash flow goals for the full year. Our balance sheet continues to be strong, with net debt leverage within our targeted range of 2x to 2.5x. As James mentioned, much has happened since we last gave guidance in February. The conflict in Ukraine has created further volatility in the world as well as added to the inflationary backdrop and impacted the currency market. The resurgence of COVID in China and some other geographies around the world is a clear indication that the pandemic is still very much a part of the conversation, and a reminder that the recovery path has been and will continue to be asynchronous. Obviously, there are lots of puts and takes at play, and we see a number of potential futures coming at us. But notwithstanding this backdrop, we believe our organization is better prepared today, and we're confident in the flexibility we've built and our ability to manage what's around the corner. We continue to spin the growth flywheels faster, and our local businesses are adapting and executing for growth. With that in mind, this morning, we are reiterating our guidance for 2022. We continue to expect organic revenue growth of approximately 7% to 8% and comparable currency-neutral earnings per share guidance of 8% to 10% growth versus 2021. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we are reiterating our currency outlook of a 2- to 3-point currency headwinds to comparable net revenues and a 3- to 4-point currency headwinds to comparable earnings per share for full year 2022. Additionally, taking into account our current understanding of recently issued regulations, we now expect an effective tax rate of 19.5% in 2022 versus the 20% that we had guided to previously. All in, we continue to expect comparable earnings per share growth of 5% to 6% versus 2021. And we continue to expect to generate approximately $10.5 billion of free cash flow for 2022 through approximately $12 billion in cash from operations, less approximately $1.5 billion in capital investments. To put this guidance in context, there are some considerations to keep in mind for 2022. The direct impact of the Ukraine conflict and the resulting suspension of business in Russia is estimated to be approximately $0.04 to comparable EPS. The recent increases in commodity costs are having an incremental effect. But based on current rates and hedge positions, we expect the commodity price inflation to remain in the range of mid-single digit impact on comparable cost of goods sold in 2022. Additionally, we see incremental cost pressure coming from areas like wages and transportation. The consolidation of the BODYARMOR finished goods business will continue to have a mechanical effect on margins. When it comes to capital allocation, our priorities remain the same, and we continue to balance financial flexibility with efficient capital structure. For 2022, we announced a dividend increase of 5%, a higher rate than in recent years; and we also announced the resumption of share repurchases with approximately $500 million in net share repurchases expected this year. Despite uncertainties around the world, our strategic transformation has fortified the organization to weather the storm, and we are extremely proud of how our people are responding and delivering. We are keeping consumers at the center, operating more effectively and efficiently and unlocking the immense potential of our growth portfolio of brands. This gives us confidence that we can deliver on our guidance for 2022. And with that, operator, we are ready to take questions. . Our first question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. I was hoping we could talk a little bit more about Latin America, an area like you called out about performance, in particular, Mexico and Brazil this quarter. And I had sort of 2 sets of questions. One is this is a region where your partnership with bottling has been particularly strong certainly versus the past. And if you could talk a little bit about how that may be enabling your ability to be performing as well as you are in this challenging time. So that's kind of one. And then two was there was a mention in the release about shares being down. It looked -- I'm guessing it might be in juice because I think you talked about sparkling being up, but anything in particular you're doing or the degree to which the market share performance is an area, a watch point for you and how you're balancing that versus thinking about recovering cost inflation. Yes. There was -- I think we'll call that several questions. I never do it, though. So I'm sorry. It's the first time. Okay. We'll be -- in the spirit of generosity, we'll try and -- because they're very related. Look, we have a great partnership with our bottlers in Latin America from the 2 very big ones. Coke FEMSA, Arca Continental, through Andina and some of the more country-based bottlers. And we have developed collectively the system, many capabilities on many fronts, whether it be marketing automation, but particularly, the levers of revenue growth management and execution in volatile times. It escapes no one's attention that Latin America was a place that has had a rollercoaster of economic growth and inflation and difficulties. And we have a very deep partnership with these bottlers to work through these times. And that, I think, you see reflected in this quarter as we had a lot of good growth. The share did come in negative overall. I think there's a couple of things going on there. As you say, we did a lot better in sparkling, a lot of good execution in sparkling. And there was some pressure as much in juice or some of the juice drink categories, but also category mix. We are very much focused on, as we've talked about previously that when you are in a cost environment, that those cost increases, whether it be commodities or wages or logistics or marketing costs, need to go through over time. We have to earn the right for the brands to take if they need to go through. Sometimes when you're in a very high share market like Latin America and you lead on pricing, not all competitors necessarily follow immediately, and that can have temporary impacts on share. But we, with the bottlers, will be very focused on not only continuing to carry on growing, but to regain and expand our share position. Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. So I just want to focus on top line visibility here. You obviously kept the full year top line guidance despite the Russia impact. So underlying sales are moving OpEx. Russia, in Q1, was another strong quarter. But clearly, there's risk consumer spending might weaken with the unprecedented inflation we're seeing. So first, maybe just looking backwards, can you give us an update on if you're seeing any signs of consumer stress in terms of impact on your business or pushback to higher pricing around the world, either late in Q1 or in April? And then also on a go-forward basis, can you juxtapose the positive impact of normalization of COVID behavior on your business as away-from-home recovers maybe versus any potential macro pressure you could see our consumer spending weakness? And how that impacts your visibility in terms of full year top line view? Well, clearly, my active generosity, and Lauren has unleashed a torrent of multi-question questions, but it would be harsh to cut it off at this stage, Dara. Look, a couple of things. We did come in with strong momentum out of 2021 and coming to this year. And as I and John and we talked about previously on calls, we believe that pricing for our business has to be earned for the brands. We have to give the consumer and the retailer reason for the price increase and for the value of our brands, whether it's the marketing, the innovation, the execution or the packaging options, we do that. It's not a cost-plus business, although we do seek, of course, to protect the margin structure by moving through changes in commodities and other costs.  But we very much foresee as experience and history -- who was it? Mark Twain said, history doesn't repeat itself, it just rhymes. But when you go into high inflation, consumers come under pressure. There's clearly reductions in real purchasing power going on for some segments of the population, if not everyone around the world. And so our focus is very much to find those packaging and price options by channel where we can stay connected to people who are coming under purchasing power pressure, very much the affordability just building on the Latin America example for the last question; a lot of focus on returnable, refillable bottles because the economics of those packages work to an extent that you can have a lower price point for the package. And with reductions in purchasing power, we very much see the actual out-of-pocket price point and keeping a low entry point into the category is very important, also pushing the expansion of refillables in places like South Africa. So very much acting on the signs of consumer purchasing power pressure, but very much also anticipating that it will increase. It would be great if there were a perfect landing out of this inflationary environment. The rhyme of history would tell you that at some point, either inflation or reduction in purchasing power or supply constraints eventually create a bump. And at that point, we will want to both be accessing the premium opportunities that have but very much with an anchor in the affordability and entry price point opportunities and necessities as consumers come under pressure. Our next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. When I think about -- just to approach to capital allocation and business reinvestment, as you talked about it in the prepared remarks, you framed it as essentially unchanged as a framework. But with all the variability you called out in the operating environment, I guess I'm curious as to where there are areas of your going in plans where maybe you pulled back a bit versus other areas where you found yourself now leading in more? Maybe James, to your answer to the last question, maybe it's affordability or something like that. But just again, over my sense is it's moving around a lot under the cover. So just I'm curious how that kind of agility is manifesting in terms of reallocations of spend. Thanks, Steve, it's John. Let me first just lay the picture of total capital allocation. The first priority is to invest in the business. And as we -- as James just said, when you think about the environment that we're -- we have been dealing in and we will be dealing with the rest of the year, the name of the game right now is to do exactly that is to continue to invest in our brands so that we have the wherewithal to manage through whatever comes at us. I think at a local level, the mix of investments is something that we continue to be very flexible with. And we are leveraging the work that we have been doing over the last couple of years to be even more effective in how we're spending our marketing dollars, whether it's on building our brands or whether it's on supporting our RGM efforts in the marketplace. The other areas of our capital allocation framework, supporting the dividend, looking at opportunistic M&A and share repurchase, we covered in the script with the dividend and share repurchase, we continue to be very open as to what opportunities may be out there. But in the here and now, the top priority is investing appropriately in the business. And as I say, the mix of that investment is something that varies and will continue to vary depending on what we need to do locally. Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. I had just a big picture question about how you're working with your bottlers who are experiencing pretty sharp cost pressures to essentially help them navigate through this tough environment, if you guys could talk about that. And also looking at the equity income in the quarter, it remained relatively strong, but is the expectation going forward that there will be a greater impact in the next couple of quarters, given some of these pressures? Yes. Sure, Bonnie. I mean I'm not sure it would be appropriate to comment on equity income into the future for our bottling partners. But as we go into a tough environment, as we always do historically, we make sure that we intensify our collaboration and partnership with our bottlers, both to work on what are the marketing programs and the innovation programs that are going to work in the consumer and the retail environment that we face wherever we are in the world, and also the execution initiatives and focus areas that bottlers can drive on. Because firstly, the environment is not the same in every country around the world. Some are opening up exuberantly and actually chasing and keeping up with demand and the kind of the reopening euphoria, all the way across the spectrum to parts of China like Shanghai, which is in full lockdown as though it were April 2020. So the environment is absolutely not the same in every country, and we have to work where on the curve of all the change, are we and be very clear. And in terms of the pressures, you talked about it, the pressure is both headwind and tailwind. Clearly, there are headwinds in terms of cost, whether it be commodities, logistics, wages. And as I said earlier in one of the questions, we work with our system, our bottling partners, to make sure we protect and sustain the margin structure over time. That's not necessarily true every single quarter, but that is our overall objective: earning the right to price the brands so that the system has the sort of margin structure and stability of that over the course of time, if not every single quarter. But there are headwinds there. Balancing those headwinds, there are tailwinds out there, as I said. The reopenings provide fuel not just for overall demand, but improvements in channels, away-from-home channels where we're strong and leaning in with investment produces great results. So this is -- there's a lot of variables at play in the downhill of the year and really just the key is the intense partnership with our bottlers to make the most of the opportunity ahead of us and to prepare ourselves for step 2 and step 3 further down the road. Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. James, I wanted to just circle back to the comments you made in the prepared remarks about ESG and, I guess, tying it to comp. If I understood the proxy correctly, there’s been 2 changes. One is the ESG component now being a portion of both the annual and long-term comp. I think it moves to 10%. And then also for your annual long-term incentive comp, the amount that's paid out in stock options, I think, goes up from like 1/3 to 1/2. So just wanted to sort of get your perspective on why make those changes now? And just what it signals about your focus going forward? Yes. Thanks, Bryan. Yes, I mean, firstly, we'd refer everyone who wants a greater depth to the proxy that's out there on our website, and we've tried to lay out some of the mechanics and our thinking behind the 2. We have made some changes, as you point out, Bryan, to the way the long-term incentives or more specifically, the performance share units, which are kind of a 3-year program. We've got a 10% element in that that's linked to our ESG goals. And so we are laying out some very specific targets that will drive a portion of those payouts. And because some of those ESG objectives take some time to execute against, we felt they were better embedded into the 3-year stock award programs. And then secondly, as you point out, with the Board and with the Compensation Committee, we felt to increase greater alignment with shareowners. We would readjust the balance of performance share units versus options for myself and push that up to 50%. I mean you can take that as a confidence in the future, but that's one very small stone on the large pile of stones of things we do to demonstrate that we believe this is a great company with a great future. Our next question comes from Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets. This is Filippo Falorni on for Nick. My question is on pricing.","['Bryan Spillane', 'John Murphy', 'Tim Leveridge', 'James Quincey', 'Bonnie Herzog', 'Filippo Falorni', 'Dara Mohsenian', 'Operator', 'Steve Powers', 'Lauren Lieberman']"
8,ABBV,1,2022,2022-04-29 11:20:02,"Good morning and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AbbVie First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer portion of this call.  Today’ conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Vice President, Head of Investor Relations. Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Michael, Vice Chairman, Finance and Commercial Operations and Chief Financial Officer; Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer; and Tom Hudson, Senior Vice President, R&D, and Chief Scientific Officer. Joining us for the Q&A portion of the call are Carrie Strom, Senior Vice President and President, Global Allergan Aesthetics; Neil Gallagher, Vice President and Chief Medical Officer; and Roopal Thakkar, Vice President, Global Regulatory Affairs. Before we get started, some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.

These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rick. Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll briefly comment on our overall performance, then Jeff, Tom and Rob will review our first quarter business highlights, pipeline progress and financial results in more detail. I'm pleased with the excellent start to 2022. It further reinforces our confidence in the long-term fundamentals of the business. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.16, exceeding our expectations. Total net revenue of more than $13.5 billion was up 5.4% on an operational basis, also above our expectations. These results demonstrate strong momentum across several key products and portfolios, including robust double-digit operational revenue growth from Skyrizi, Rinvoq, Neuroscience and Aesthetics. Skyrizi is performing exceptionally well. We are achieving impressive market share gains in psoriasis, which remains a significant market opportunity. Skyrizi's recent launch in psoriatic arthritis as well as the anticipated regulatory approval in Crohn's disease should also serve as important growth drivers over the long-term. Rinvoq is also contributing compelling sales growth. Subscription trends in RA have recently stabilized as we expected and we are making excellent progress repositioning the brand as the leading second-line agent based on the robust data generated across our broad development programs. The early launch trends for Rinvoq in both atopic dermatitis and psoriatic arthritis are highly encouraging, with commercial access and paid prescriptions expected to ramp significantly over the coming months. We anticipate that these two new indications, along with the recent US approval in ulcerative colitis, should add substantial revenue growth for Rinvoq over the long term. Neuroscience remains an exciting opportunity for our company. Vraylar continues to have strong momentum across our currently approved indications and the pending regulatory approval in major depressive disorder represents a significant upside to current projections. In migraine, our portfolio of distinct therapies with Ubrelvy, Qulipta and Botox Therapeutic is demonstrating robust double-digit sales growth. With the migraine market anticipated to roughly double in size over the next several years, there is significant headroom for continued revenue growth with these compelling therapies. Aesthetics is once again exceeding expectations. The category continues to grow robust double-digits, especially in toxins and fillers, where there is substantial opportunity for further market penetration. Our commercial team is executing at a high level with targeted promotion and enhanced digital services, including our Alle loyalty program driving strong market share performance across our major brands. In summary, this is an exciting time for AbbVie, and I'm extremely pleased with the evolution and momentum of our diverse portfolio. We're making excellent progress with the launches of several new products and indications, which will collectively add meaningful revenue for AbbVie as commercial access ramps for each of these opportunities over the remainder of this year. We're off to another exceptional start, and our long-term growth prospects remain strong. I'd now like to take a brief moment to thank Mike Severino for his contributions to the success of AbbVie over the last eight years. As you know, Mike has decided to leave AbbVie at the end of May to pursue another career opportunity, and we wish him all the best. I'd also like to take this opportunity to formally introduce to you Tom Hudson. Tom joined AbbVie back in 2016 as the Head of Discovery and Early Development. In 2018, Tom undertook responsibilities for AbbVie's entire discovery organization. Then in 2019, was promoted to the Head of AbbVie R&D and Chief Scientific Officer, where he assumed responsibility for all of AbbVie's R&D. Tom has an impressive background as a clinical scientist. His medical specialty is in clinical immunology and allergy. Tom played a critical role in the human genome project while working at both the Whitehead Institute and MIT, where Tom led the team that mapped the human genome. Tom was also instrumental in the international half map project to refine the genetic architecture of the human genome. Tom went on to further lead the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, which included discovery and translational cancer research with a clinical network of more than 1,000 investigators. Tom will be providing an update on our continued pipeline progress to you later in the call. But first, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff? Thank you, Rick. We continue to demonstrate strong commercial execution across our therapeutic portfolio. I'll start with Immunology, which delivered global revenues of more than $6.1 billion, reflecting growth of 8.1% on an operational basis. Humira global sales were approximately $4.7 billion, down 1.8% on an operational basis with low single-digit revenue growth in the US, offset by biosimilar competition across international markets, where revenues were down 17.9% operationally.  Skyrizi global revenues were $940 million, reflecting positive momentum in both approved indications. In psoriasis, Skyrizi is demonstrating impressive market share gains globally. Skyrizi now accounts for approximately 23% of the total prescription share in the US biologic market. Skyrizi's in-play psoriasis share, which includes both new and switching patients, also remains very, very strong and now reflects roughly 40% patient share in the US and a clear number one leadership position.  Skyrizi is performing exceptionally well internationally, where we have now achieved approximately 10% psoriasis share across our top 12 markets, as well as in-play share leadership in more than 20 key countries. While we were early in our launch in psoriatic arthritis, we are encouraged by the uptake in this indication. In the dermatology segment, Skyrizi has already achieved in-play patient share of more than 10% in the US.  Internationally, Skyrizi PSA is now approved in 45 countries, with reimbursement expected to increase throughout the year. Importantly, we are also preparing for the launch of Skyrizi in Crohn's disease, which represents another important long-term growth driver with approval decisions anticipated this year.  Turning now to Rinvoq, which delivered global sales of $465 million, demonstrating continued strong growth. As anticipated, we have seen an impact on new patient starts following the label update and Rinvoq prescriptions have now stabilized in the U.S., with in-play market share currently 12% in RA. We expect growth in the second line plus RA setting going forward where our field force is now focused on leveraging compelling data from two important Phase III trials.  First, SELECT-CHOICE, which demonstrated Rinvoq's superiority versus ORENCIA across key efficacy parameters, including clinical remission in previously treated RA patients. And second, the open-label extension of SELECT-COMPARE which demonstrated that many RA patients with an inadequate response to Humira are able to achieve remission after switching to Rinvoq.  Early feedback suggests this updated Rinvoq RA messaging is resonating very well with healthcare practitioners. Internationally, Rinvoq share continues to ramp in RA with a total market share of approximately 5.5% across key geographies. We are also making excellent progress with Rinvoq's newly launched indications, including atopic dermatitis, psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis.  Managed care access is expected to ramp strongly for each of these indications over the coming months. As we build access, initial prescriptions are covered by our BRIDGE program. which provides free patients or free goods to patients until formulary coverage is established. As a reminder, the volume from our BRIDGE program is not captured in third-party prescription data.  I'll start with atopic dermatitis. We are seeing new patient starts accelerating as we build access. When you include prescriptions from our Bridge program, Rinvoq total in-play AD share is already in the mid-teens. So, we are pleased with the early adoption and repeating prescribers. As an oral option that provides significant skin clearance and itch relief, we believe Rinvoq has a strong differentiated position in this highly underpenetrated AD market. In PSA, we are seeing a nice uptake in Rinvoq's in-play share, especially in the rheum segment, where the severity of joint or skin manifestations of the disease can vary significantly by patients. And importantly, we have also launched Skyrizi in the rheum-PSA segment this quarter, giving us two very compelling therapies to address the wide range of PSA patient types, regardless of how their symptoms present. We have also launched our first indication in the IBD segment, Rinvoq for ulcerative colitis, where we are seeing a significant long-term opportunity in the second-line plus setting. Nearly 50% of UC patients are currently on or have used TNF therapy, so the addressable patient population is substantial. Given the strong benefit risk in this indication, we believe Rinvoq will be a welcome therapeutic option for UC patients and physicians. Turning now to hematologic oncology. Global revenues were more than $1.6 billion, down 0.6% on an operational basis. Imbruvica global revenues were approximately $1.2 billion, down 7.4%. There are two factors impacting our Imbruvica results. First, we are seeing greater market share erosion in new patient starts than originally anticipated from newer therapy, including other BTK inhibitors, as well as our own Venclexta. Second, we continue to see higher-than-expected COVID suppression on new patient starts in CLL, which as a treat-to-progression therapy, has impacted the total BTK treated patient market. Our guidance assumes a market recovery over the course of this year, but it's too early to determine exactly how this may play out, given the continued impact from recent COVID variant. Despite these dynamics, Imbruvica remains the market-leading therapy for total patients across CLL and several other major blood cancers. Based on the magnitude of clinical data and real-world evidence generated for Imbruvica, showing sustained disease control as well as overall patient survival, we are confident it will continue to be a meaningful product for AbbVie over the long term. Venclexta, however, is helping to offset some of the headwinds facing Imbruvica. Global sales were $473 million, up 21.1% on an operational basis. In the US, Venclexta's the clear market share leader in frontline AML, among patients who are ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy and recently achieved leading new patient share in second line plus PLL. We are also seeing robust momentum internationally, with strong performance across all approved indications. Additionally, we continue to make excellent progress building out our hem/onc portfolio, with several compelling late-stage assets, such as epcoritamab for B-cell malignancies, Navitoclax for myelofibrosis and ABBV-383 for multiple myeloma, expected support -- expected to support sustainable long-term growth. Turning now to neuroscience, where revenues were approximately $1.5 billion, up more than 20% on an operational basis, including robust double-digit growth from Vraylar, Botox Therapeutic and Ubrelvy. Ubrelvy is performing very well and continues to be the market-leading oral CGRP treatment for acute migraine, with sequential demand growth observed. Qulipta is also demonstrating exceptional uptake in migraine prevention, with recent total prescriptions performing ahead of comparable branded launches. Qulipta is now capturing nearly 25% on of the new-to-brand share in the US preventative CGRP class when we consider both paid and bridge volume. We expect commercial access to continue to ramp strongly over the remainder of the year. Qulipta has also recently demonstrated positive results from a registration-enabling study for the preventative treatment of chronic migraine, which we plan to submit to the agency for potential expanded use in the US as well as to support regulatory applications across the international market. This indication, if approved, will provided added differentiation for Qulipta as the only oral CGRP therapy for the preventative treatment of both episodic and chronic migraine. In our other notable therapeutic, eye care revenues of $771 million were down 2.8% on an operational basis with recent generic competition for Restasis unfavorably impacting our results. Mavyret sales were $380 million, down 4.6% on an operational basis as treated patient volumes remain depressed compared to pre-COVID levels. So, overall, I'm extremely pleased with our execution across the therapeutic portfolio, including the progress we are making with recent new product launches. We remain on-track to deliver strong revenue growth once again in 2022. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom for additional comments on our R&D program. Tom? Thank you, Jeff. I'll start with immunology. We recently received FDA approval for Rinvoq in ulcerative colitis, a disease where there continues to be a significant unmet need for therapies that can provide high response rates and durable remission. In our UC development program, Rinvoq demonstrated some of the highest rates of remission and endoscopic improvements seen in Phase 3 studies. Importantly, Rinvoq also provided durable responses sustained through one year of treatment. Given the strong benefit risk profile, we believe Rinvoq will be an important new medicine for patients. Our regulatory applications for Rinvoq in UC remain under review in Europe and Japan, with approval decisions expected in the second half of this year. Also in the area of inflammatory bowel disease, we recently reported positive topline results from the second Phase 3 induction study for Rinvoq in Crohn's disease. Similar to results from the first induction trial, in this induction study, Rinvoq demonstrated a very strong impact on the disease as measured by clinical remission and endoscopic response. We expect to see results from the Phase 3 maintenance study later in the quarter with our regulatory submissions for Rinvoq and Crohn's disease expected in the third quarter and approval decisions anticipated in 2023. Rounding out Rinvoq's development programs in rheumatology, we also have regulatory applications under review in ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial SpA. We expect an FDA approval decision in the second quarter for AS and decisions in the fourth quarter for non-radiographic axial SpA. Moving to Skyrizi, where in the quarter, we announced an update regarding our regulatory application for Crohn's disease in the US. Following an FDA request for additional information, primarily related to the on-body injection device used for maintenance dosing, we provided additional data for the device from an ongoing real-life use study, which showed that patients can safely and effectively use the on-body device to self-administer Skyrizi. After responding to the agency's request, we received a 3-month extension of our Skyrizi submission in Crohn's disease. We remain confident in a strong benefit risk profile for Skyrizi in Crohn's disease and we now expect a decision in June. Moving now to our Oncology Portfolio, where we continue to make excellent progress across all stages of our heme and solid tumor pipeline. We recently announced positive top line results from the first expansion cohort of the Phase II study, evaluating epcoritamab in patients with aggressive B-cell lymphoma who have received at least two prior lines of therapy.  Epcoritamab performed extremely well as a monotherapy in these heavily pretreated and high-risk patients, demonstrating an overall response rate of 63% with a median duration of response of 12 months. These results are particularly encouraging, given that nearly 40% of patients had failed CAR-T therapy. We plan to discuss these results with regulatory agencies about the potential to support submission for accelerated approval in the second half of this year. We continue to make good progress with the indication expansion programs for Venclexta and remain on-track to see results from the Phase III CANOVA trial in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients with a t(11;14) mutation in the second half of this year. In our Venclexta MDS program, based on feedback from the FDA, we have recently modified our regulatory strategy and now intend to submit data from our ongoing Phase III program. Venclexta remains under Breakthrough Therapy Designation for MDS and we continue to have a high degree of enthusiasm for Venclexta in this indication. We expect data readout from the Phase III study and our regulatory submission for MDS in 2024. In Neuroscience, the FDA recently accepted our application for Vraylar as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder. Based on the strong benefit-risk profile demonstrated in our clinical program, we believe Vraylar will be an important new therapy in this patient population, and we look forward to bringing this new treatment option to patients suffering from major depressive disorders.  In the area of migraine, we recently reported positive topline results from a Phase III study evaluating Qulipta for the prevention of chronic migraine. Qulipta performed very well in this study with both doses meeting the primary and all secondary endpoints, demonstrating Qulipta's ability to significantly reduce migraine days for patients suffering from chronic migraine.  This summer, we plan to submit our regulatory application to the FDA for Qulipta in chronic migraine and also plan to submit data from our Phase III studies in both chronic migraine and episodic migraine to support regulatory applications in markets outside the US. In our cystic fibrosis program, we recently completed an interim analysis of a Phase II proof-of-concept study evaluating our triple combination therapy. The results – the efficacy results from this interim analysis did not meet our prespecified criteria for advancing this triple therapy in development. This study was designed with a 28-day run-in treatment period, with a dual combination therapy containing our C1 corrector and potentiator, followed by a 28-day treatment period, with a triple combination, which included the addition of our C2 corrector, ABBV-119. This allowed us to independently assess the therapeutic potential of our C2 corrector. The results showed that the addition of 119 did not provide a meaningful improvement in FEV1 or reduction in sweat chloride concentration over our dual combination therapy. During the run-in treatment period, we were able to again assess the efficacy of our dual therapy, which performed well, providing efficacy consistent with results for the existing dual accommodation therapy. So based on the performance of our dual therapy, we plan to continue our CF program. We have an additional C2 corrector, ABBV-576 in Phase 1 studies that we plan to advance into a new triple therapy with our existing C1 corrector and potentiator. 576 is structurally distinct from our previous C2 corrector 119 and has a better PK profile and provides higher drug exposure, which has the potential to deliver better efficacy. Our plan is to begin a Phase 2 study for this new triple combo by early next year. And in Aesthetics, we recently began the Phase 3 program for our short-acting toxin in Glabellar Lines. This novel toxin is designed to provide rapid onset of action and a short duration of effect, which would lower the barrier for adoption for certain segment of consumers. We expect to see data from this program next year with regulatory applications also anticipated in 2023. So in summary, we've continued to make significant progress with our pipeline to start the year, and we look forward to many more data readouts, regulatory submissions and approvals throughout the remainder of 2022. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our first quarter performance and financial outlook. Rob? Thank you, Tom. AbbVie's first quarter results demonstrate the strength of our broad portfolio, including double-digit growth from Skyrizi, Rinvoq, Venclexta, Neuroscience and Aesthetics. We also continue to deliver strong P&L performance, with another quarter of robust operating margin expansion, while fully funding the business for long-term growth. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.16, reflecting growth of 9.3% compared to prior year and $0.04 above our guidance midpoint. This includes an $0.08 unfavorable impact of acquired IPR&D expense that was not factored into our original guidance. Total net revenues were more than $13.5 billion, up 5.4% on an operational basis, excluding a 1.3% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Net revenues came in above our guidance despite the entry of generic competition for Restasis. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 51.4% of sales, an improvement of 150 basis points versus the prior year. This includes adjusted gross margin of 84.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 10.9% of sales, acquired IPR&D expense of 1.1% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of 21.1% of sales. Net interest expense was $539 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 12.1%. Turning to our financial outlook, we are updating our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to include the $0.08 for acquired IPR&D expense that was incurred during the first quarter. As a result, we now expect full year adjusted earnings per share between $13.92 and $14.12. This earnings per share guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred beyond the first quarter. We now expect net revenues of approximately $59.4 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.4% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. This revenue guidance includes updated Restasis sales of approximately $400 million. Moving to the P&L, we now expect adjusted gross margin of 84.5% of sales, adjusted SG&A expense of $12.5 billion, and an adjusted operating margin ratio of 51.8% of sales. Turning to the second quarter, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $14.6 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.5% unfavorable impact on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.38 and $3.42. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. In closing, we are off to an excellent start to the year with strong performance across multiple areas. We are making significant progress with new product launches and the pipeline, underscoring our confidence in AbbVie's long-term growth outlook. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz. Thanks, Rob. We will now open the call for questions. In the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or two. Operator, we'll take the first question, please. Thank you. Our first question comes from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Your line is open Great. Thanks for taking my question. And maybe to begin with on Imbruvica. So, I mean, the script trends are down, and you mentioned that we are -- for new starts, you are losing some share to the competition. When you think -- can you please characterize how much share you are losing? And do you think it will stabilize over time? And when you look at Imbruvica and Venclexta combined, do you think the franchise can grow going forward from here? Thank you. Yes. Thank you for the question. So, as I mentioned in my comments, we are seeing greater share erosion. Imbruvica continues to be the leading share in the later lines, although we have lost our frontline share position to Calquence. And obviously, Venclexta is also moving there. So we see a couple of things that are taking place. So, we have that share erosion that's putting some pressure on the brand. And then clearly, we see the continued suppression of the market. So, it's kind of like a double hit. If we think of this over the short, mid and longer term, what I would say would be this. So, in the short-term, meaning this year, we projected the share decline and that includes some stabilization, but we still think the brand is under some pressure from other BTKs and Venclexta. And basically, we have flat guidance this year. And some of that includes a recovery of the market back to sort of more normal levels and we'll have to see how that progresses over the year. If I think more about the midterm, I think what's important context there is, new patient starts essentially make up roughly 13% to 15% of Imbruvica. So it's got a very, very large installed base, about 85%, maybe a little bit more in terms of what that's going to happen. We're not seeing any changes in persistency or items like that. So we think that we have a very good sense of stability for the brand over time in terms of what this may mean. And so that's basically how we think about it. To answer your other question, if you look at the combined share, AbbVie has quite a strong position. We have roughly 33% of total share in the front line and we have between 42% and 46% of second-line plus. So clearly, Venclexta is able to offset as I commented in my remarks some of those pressures. So it's very important for AbbVie. It's going to be a very big brand over the long term. In the short term here in midterm, the growth is going to be more challenged moving forward. Thank you.  Thanks, Mohit. Operator, next question please. Thank you. Our next question comes from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Hi, thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering, obviously, you guys have been speaking with payers about the Humira positioning for 2023. Are you willing to give us any update in terms of how you're thinking about that guidance figure that you put out a couple of years ago? Any change in thinking there? And then are you able to disclose the CR rate for the recent epcoritamab Phase II trial? Just wondering how that, factors into the decision about whether to seek accelerated approval here? Thank you. So Terence, this is Rick. I'll take the first for you. And I'm probably going to answer a little broader because I think it is important. I understand the interest in trying to understand how to model 2023, it's obviously important to us to model 2023 as accurately as possible. And I think if you step back, obviously, contracting is one portion of a variable that will impact the speed at which biosimilars are able to adopt – be adopted in the market.  If you step back and look, there's probably four key variables that will impact, what that adoption rate looks like. One of them is obviously, what will Humira's access be post biosimilars entering the marketplace? And this is the period where you would normally be doing the contracting around that. I think we'll do well in being able to be co-positioned versus biosimilars in the vast majority of covered lives here in the United States. But that process isn't done, and we're not in a position to be able to ultimately, give you any further update until we're a little further along in that process.  The second variable that will impact what 2023 looks like is, how will the biosimilars price? We don't know that. Obviously, we have seen how they price in markets outside the US, but there's no market exactly like the US internationally. And so that's a variable. We're making some projections of what we believe that pricing will look like. But that's ultimately something we're going to have to see how it plays out.  I'd say the third variable is, how competitive will these biosimilars be? It's going to be by the summer of 2023, there's going to be a lot of biosimilars in the US market, but they're not all the same. And how competitive will they be against what is Humira today? And what are the bulk of patients use as it relates to Humira. And what I mean by that is interchangeability and a number of going to play into the competitiveness of those biosimilars. And I'd say the fourth variable, and it's not something that people think about that much, and that is the ability of a biosimilar to be able to supply the US market. There's no market like the United States for Humira anywhere around the world. In the United States, it's significantly larger than any other market around the world. There are certainly biosimilar players that are like an AbbVie, and I would expect them to have manufacturing capacity. There are generic players that could have sufficient manufacturing capacity, and then there are very small companies. But I think anybody -- any payer that's going to want to convert in any significant way to a biosimilar, they're going to want confidence that they can have a reliability of supply of that biosimilar and we've spent years building the network that we have. We have full redundancy of every aspect of the manufacturing process on Humira. And we've never had a problem supplying the US market. So, I think we can be viewed as kind of the gold standard. So, those are the variables that are going to impact what this transition looks like. The guidance we've given so far is this 45%, plus or minus 10%. I think at this point, that's still the best information that we can provide. Later this year, I think some of these variables will be clearer to it. And we may be in a position to be able to provide some more information to investors, and we would do that. Some will not. Pricing will not be clear at that point. We're not going to know how they're going to price until we actually get into -- they actually get into the marketplace. So, I think that's the way to think about these variables. Rob, anything you'd add? Yes. So, this is Rob. I would just add that we've been trying to give investors some directional guidance on how to think about 2023 beyond just the Humira, 45% plus or minus 10%. We've talked about Aesthetics growing high single-digits annually over the next decade. You can get a sense based on Jeff's response today and the way to think about Imbruvica, in terms of operating margin, I've talked about that pulling back to the 46% to 47% range with no cuts to investment because we're going to return to grow","['Terence Flynn', 'Rick Gonzalez', 'Liz Shea', 'Mohit Bansal', 'Jeff Stewart', 'Tom Hudson', 'Operator', 'Rob Michael']"
9,DIS,1,2022,2022-02-09 19:57:09,"Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to The Walt Disney Company's First Quarter 2022 Financial Results Conference Call.  Please be advised today's conference may be recorded.   I'd now like to hand the conference over to Jenn Kettnich, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Walt Disney Company. Please go ahead. Good afternoon, and it's my pleasure to welcome everyone to The Walt Disney Company's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is also being webcast and we'll post a transcript of this call to our website. Joining me today are Bob Chapek, Disney's Chief Executive Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Christine, we'll be happy to take some of your questions.  So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to get started. Thanks, Jenn, and good afternoon, everyone. As we begin the final year of The Walt Disney Company's first century, I am pleased to share our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2022, starting with the highlights. Our adjusted EPS of $1.06 is up from $0.32 a year ago. Our Domestic Parks and Resorts achieved all-time revenue and operating income records despite the Omicron surge. And our streaming services ended Q1 with 196.4 million total subscriptions after adding 70.4 million in the quarter, including 11.8 million Disney+ subscribers. I'll share more about those items shortly. But first, I want to talk about this unique moment in the history of The Walt Disney Company. It is perhaps fitting that our 100th anniversary comes at a time of significant change for us and our industry. In the midst of a global pandemic, fast-changing consumer expectations and a leadership transition, we reimagined our Parks business, substantially increased our investment in content creation and executed a reorganization that will facilitate our ongoing transformation. Each of those actions has helped set the stage for our second century, and as we approach that remarkable milestone, I am filled with optimism. We have the world's most creative storytelling engine, an unmatched collection of brands and franchises and an ability to tell stories that form deep emotional connections with audiences. We have a portfolio of distribution platforms, including powerful and growing streaming services. We have diverse revenue streams that span business models and industries, but which all are interconnected to create entertainment's most powerful synergy machine. We have the country's top news organization and the most trusted brand for following sports and our theme parks continue to be the most magical places on earth. In short, our collection of assets and platforms, creative capabilities in unique place and the cultural zeitgeist give me great confidence that we will continue to define entertainment for the next 100 years. To carry through on that promise, we will be guided by 3 strategic pillars: storytelling excellence, innovation and audience focus. Storytelling excellence is, of course, dependent on having excellent storytellers. I am thrilled to share that our legacy of being home to the most accomplished leaders in the industry will continue, as nearly all of our top creative executives have recently renewed, extended or signed new contracts. I could not be more excited to continue working with these creative powerhouses. The quality content from our teams was recognized just yesterday with a fantastic 23 Oscar nominations, including 3 of the 5 best animated feature films: Pixar's Luca; Walt Disney Animation's Raya and the Last Dragon; and our newest franchise, Walt Disney Animation's Encanto, which received 3 nominations. Summer of Soul was recognized in the best documentary category, and Nightmare Alley and West Side Story both received best picture nominations. As you may have seen earlier today, we announced West Side Story will debut in most Disney+ markets on March 2 and we can't wait for our subscribers to see this incredible film. In Q1, our studios took us deeper into the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Eternals and the Disney+ original series, Hawkeye. And returned us to that galaxy far, far away with another Disney+ original series of Book of Boba Fett. Our general entertainment teams also continued to produce programming of the highest quality. In fact, last year, our general entertainment team produced nearly 1/4 of the industry's best review shows. And Q1 saw 10 of their shows achieved a 100% critic score on Rotten Tomatoes. That includes Abbott Elementary, the first Freshman Broadcast comedy to earn the 100% certified fresh score since ABC's own Modern Family in 2009. Our success in branded storytelling is, of course, no secret. However, it's often lost that the depth, breadth and quality of our general entertainment content is also a driving force behind the success of our streaming services. In fact, 6 of the 10 most watched programs across our services are general entertainment titles produced by our own team. And general entertainment is an increasingly powerful driver of engagement in most of our international markets where such content is already included in our service under the Star brand. Going forward, integrating more owned general entertainment into our services, especially Disney+, will be a priority. In fact, just today, we added episodes of Grown-ish, Blackish and the Wonder Years to our domestic Disney+ service. Rounding out our content focuses, is of course, sports.  Sporting events continue to be the most powerful draw in television accounting for 95 of the 100 most watched live broadcast in 2021, and ESPN once again set the bar this quarter with live games across each of our 4 major U.S. sports, including the revolutionary Monday Night with Peyton and Eli. And I am pleased to announce that we have expanded our agreement with Peyton Manning and its Omaha Productions Company to extend our relationship through the 2024 NFL season, and we'll add alternative presentations for UFC golf and college football events for each of the next 3 years. While multiplatform television and streaming will continue to be the foundation of sports coverage for the immediate future, we believe the opportunity for The Walt Disney Company goes well beyond these channels. It extends to sports betting, gaming and the metaverse. In fact, that's what excites us, the opportunity to build a sports machine akin to our franchise flywheel that enables audiences to experience, connect with and become actively engaged with our favorite sporting events, stories, teams and players. Turning to distribution results. The continued growth of our streaming services was certainly a standout. Our success at Disney+ this quarter was not the result of any one item, but instead a combination of organic growth and powerful new content, our strategic decision to include the Disney bundle with all Hulu Live subscriptions and new market launches. The remainder of this fiscal year will feature compelling Disney+ originals from across our brands and franchises, beginning with Pixar's Turning Red and Marvel Studios Moon Night in March. And the back half of FY '22 will feature a truly stunning array of content, including 2 Star Wars series: Andor, and the highly anticipated Obi-Wan Kenobi, which I am excited to announce will premiere on May 25. We'll debut 2 Marvel series, Ms. Marvel and She-Hulk; fresh new shorts from Disney Animation and Pixar, featuring the worlds of Big Hero 6 and Cars; a live-action reimagining of the Disney Classic Pinocchio, starring Tom Hanks as Geppetto; and one of the most anticipated sequels in some time, especially in the Chapek household, Hocus Pocus 2. As I've said before, we continue to manage our services for the long term and maintain confidence in our guidance of 230 million to 260 million total paid Disney+ subscribers globally by the end of fiscal 2024. Christine will provide more detail into our theatrical results. However, I want to reiterate that we continue to see value in the moviegoing experience, especially for big franchise blockbusters. And given the performance of titles like Spider- No Way Home, we are looking forward to kicking off our summer slate with another Marvel franchise film, Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. That said, audiences will be our North Star as we determine how our content is distributed. And we do not subscribe to the belief that theatrical distribution is the only way to build a Disney franchise. This quarter, audience has proved us right, as Encanto became a phenomenon within days of its arrival on Disney+ after families continued reluctance to return to theaters resulted in a muted theatrical performance. With outstanding music from Lin-Manuel Miranda, it became the fastest titled across 200 million hours viewed on Disney+ and took social media by storm. People around the world expressed their fandom through their own content and conversation and the Encanto hashtag has been viewed more than 11 billion times. The sound track, which debuted at #197 on the Billboard 200 Chart reached #1 shortly after debuting on Disney+ and 8 of the film songs hit the Hot 100 Chart, including We Don't Talk About Bruno, which became the first Disney song to reach #1 since Aladdin’s Whole New World in 1993. At the same time, sales of Encanto merchandise defied traditional post-holiday declines and actually increased following the film's release on Disney+ on Christmas Eve and guests at Disney California Adventure have loved seeing Mirabel in real life. These results are exactly what you would expect from the launch of a new Disney franchise and we are thrilled that Disney+ was the catalyst. We are more confident than ever in this platform as a content service, a franchise engine and as a venue for the next generation of Disney storytelling. Finally, I could not be more pleased with the performance of our Parks, Experiences and Products segment, which posted its second best quarter of all time. Over the last several years, we've transformed the guest experience by investing in new storytelling and ground-breaking technology and the records at our domestic parks are the direct result of this investment. From new franchise-based lands and attractions to craveable food and beverage offerings, the must-have character merchandise, there is more great Disney storytelling infused into every aspect of a visit to our parks than ever before. At the same time, we're giving guests new tools to personalize their visits and spend less time in line and more time having fun. While we anticipated these products would be popular, we have been blown away by the reception. In the quarter, more than 1/3 of domestic park guests purchased either Genie+, Lightning Lane or both. That number rose to more than 50% during the holiday period. While demand was strong throughout the quarter at both domestic sites, our reservation system enabled us to strategically manage attendance. In fact, their stellar performance was achieved at lower attendance levels than 2019. As we return to a more normalized environment, we look forward to more fully capitalizing on the extraordinary demand for our parks along with the already realized yield benefits that took shape this quarter. And we, of course, will continue to invest in the guest experience. I am personally looking forward to  Galactic Star Cruiser at Walt Disney World, a 2-night adventure into the most immersive Star Wars story ever created. We are pleased with demand for this premium ground-breaking experience, which will welcome guests starting on March 1. Later this summer, we will debut an innovative new rollercoaster at EPCOT, Guardians of the  Cosmic Rewind and Open Avengers Campus at Disneyland Paris, where the iconic Quinjet landed a few weeks ago ahead of the resort's 30th anniversary celebrations. I want to close by thanking our 195,000 employees for bringing Disney magic to audiences and guests around the world, especially in times like these, when the world needs it most. Our company is truly extraordinary, and I am honored to work with the most talented team in the industry to create the next generation of Disney stories and experiences through our focus on storytelling excellence, innovation and our audience. With that, I'll hand it over to Christine. Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.06, an increase of $0.74 from the prior year quarter. Fiscal 2022 is off to a good start as evidenced by our first quarter results and our continued progress towards more normalized operations across our businesses. At Parks, Experiences and Products, operating income was up $2.6 billion year-over-year as all of our parks and resorts around the world were open for the entirety of the fiscal first quarter. In the prior year quarter, Walt Disney World Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort were open for the entire quarter, while Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Disneyland Paris were each open for a limited number of weeks and Disneyland Resort was closed for the entire quarter. At our domestic parks, we were very pleased with the strong levels of demand we saw from both Walt Disney World and Disneyland. And as Bob mentioned, our reservation system has allowed us to strategically manage attendance. Overall, attendance trends at our domestic parks continued to strengthen in the quarter with Walt Disney World and Disneyland’s Q1 attendance up double digits versus Q4, in part reflecting holiday seasonality. Per capita spending at our domestic parks was up more than 40% versus fiscal first quarter 2019 driven by a more favorable guest and ticket mix, higher food, beverage and merchandise spending and contributions from Genie+ and Lightning Light. Putting these factors together, our domestic Parks and Resorts delivered Q1 revenue and operating income exceeding pre-pandemic levels, even as we continue managing attendance to responsibly address ongoing COVID considerations. Looking ahead to Q2, our demand pipeline for domestic guests at Walt Disney World and Disneyland remained strong, benefiting from our 50th anniversary celebration at Walt Disney World and new attractions and experiences at both parks. At International Parks, a profitable first quarter reflected improving trends at Disneyland Paris. We also saw improved results at Hong Kong Disneyland although the resort is now temporarily closed in response to a resurgence in COVID cases in the region. We expect International Parks will continue to be impacted by COVID-related volatility for the remainder of Q2. Moving on to our Media and Entertainment Distribution segment. First quarter operating income decreased by more than $600 million versus the prior year as revenue growth across our lines of business was more than offset by higher programming and production costs. Revenue growth in the quarter was primarily driven by increased subscription fees from our direct-to-consumer services. We also delivered record advertising revenues for the segment as we continue to see strong advertiser demand for our live sports and streaming and digital businesses. Turning to our results by line of business. At Linear Networks, you may recall that we guided to a decrease in operating income of nearly $500 million for Q1 versus the prior year. Operating income of $1.5 billion came in better than expected, primarily driven by our international channels, which I'll discuss in a minute. At our domestic channels, both Broadcasting and Cable operating income decreased in the first quarter versus the prior year. Lower results at Broadcasting were impacted by an adverse comparison to prior year political advertising revenue at our owned television stations, as we noted in the guidance we gave last quarter. At Cable, the year-over-year decrease in operating income reflected higher programming and production costs and increased marketing spend, partially offset by increases in advertising and affiliate revenue. Growth in advertising revenue was driven by ESPN as we benefited from the start of a normalized NBA calendar and increased viewership for football. ESPN advertising revenue in the first quarter was up 14% versus the prior year and second quarter-to-date domestic cash advertising sales at ESPN are currently pacing up. Total domestic affiliate revenue increased by 2% in the quarter. This was primarily driven by 6 points of growth from higher rates, offset by a 4-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. Operating income at our international channels decreased slightly versus the prior year. These results came in more than $200 million better than our prior guidance primarily due to lower programming and production costs as well as better-than-expected advertising and affiliate revenues. At Direct-to-Consumer, first quarter operating results decreased by $127 million year-over-year, driven by higher losses at Disney+ and ESPN+ partially offset by improved results at Hulu. I'll note that beginning this quarter, we are providing disclosure on our programming and production expenses by service as well as additional detail for Disney+ in our 10-Q. Operating losses at Disney+ increased versus the prior year as growth in subscription revenue was more than offset by higher programming, technology and marketing costs. We ended the quarter with nearly 130 million global paid Disney+ subscribers, reflecting over 11 million net additions from Q4. Taking a look at subscriber growth by region. We added 4.1 million paid domestic Disney+ subscribers, including a benefit of approximately 2 million incremental subscribers from our strategic decision to include Disney+ and ESPN+ as part of a Hulu Live subscription. In international markets, excluding Disney+ Hotstar, we added 5.1 million paid subscribers, primarily driven by growth in Asia Pacific and European markets. I'll note that growth in Asia included the benefit of new market launches in South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong in the quarter. Finally, we were able to resume growth in Disney+ Hotstar markets with 2.6 million paid subscriber additions in the quarter. Overall, we are pleased with Disney+ subscriber growth in the quarter and are looking forward to new market launches and a strong content slate later this year. As I've previously shared, we don't anticipate that subscriber growth will necessarily be linear from quarter-to-quarter, and we continue to expect growth in the back half of the fiscal year to exceed growth in the first half. At ESPN+, we ended the first quarter with over 21 million paid subscribers versus 17 million in Q4. Results decreased compared to the prior year as growth in subscription revenue was more than offset by higher sports programming costs driven by the NHL and LaLiga. And at Hulu, higher subscription revenues versus the prior year were partially offset by higher programming and production costs driven by increased affiliate fees for live TV. Hulu ended the first quarter with 45.3 million paid subscribers, inclusive of 4.3 million subscribers to our Hulu Live digital MVPD service. Moving on to content sales, licensing and other. Results decreased in the first quarter versus the prior year to an operating loss of $98 million, driven by lower theatrical results and higher film impairments, partially offset by improved TV/SVOD results. As I noted last quarter, while theatres have generally reopened, we are still experiencing a prolonged recovery to the theatrical exhibition, particularly for certain genres of films, including non-branded general entertainment and family-focused animation. This dynamic contributed to increased losses in the quarter as we released more titles in Q1 this year versus the prior year, resulting in lower theatrical results. This was partially offset by income from our coproduction of Spider- No Way Home. As we look ahead, we would like to give you some context around 2 items that may impact our second quarter results. First, as we continue to increase our investment in content, we expect programming and production costs at DMED to increase versus the prior year, primarily driven by Direct-to-Consumer and Linear Networks. At Direct-to-Consumer, we expect programming and production expenses to increase by approximately $800 million to $1 billion, including programming fees for Hulu Live. At Linear Networks, we expect programming and production expenses to increase by approximately $500 million, reflecting factors including COVID-related timing shifts. We aired 4 additional NFL games at the start of the current quarter. And as a reminder, the Academy Awards will be held in Q2 of this year, while they fell into Q3 of the prior year. Second, at content sales, licensing and other, a difficult Q2 comparison to prior year TV and SVOD program sales is due in part to our strategic decision to hold more of our owned and produced content for our direct-to-consumer services. As a result, we expect operating income to be adversely impacted by more than $200 million versus the prior year quarter. With that, I'll turn it back to Jenn, and we would be happy to take your questions. Thanks, Christine. As we transition to the Q&A, let me note that since we are not physically together this afternoon, I will do my best to moderate the Q&A by directing your questions to the appropriate executive.   And with that, operator, we're ready for the first question. Our first question comes from Ben Swinburn with Morgan Stanley. And thank you for the additional disclosure. Bob, I wanted to ask you about Disney+. The U.S. subscriber base or the, I guess, the U.S. and Canadian subscriber base is larger than we would have thought. You guys have gotten to, I think, almost -- probably more than 1/3 penetrated of total broadband homes. And it's, I guess, interesting to me because it's a narrower service than the international product, which has the Star tile. So I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you see the runway still ahead in North America for that product. And then when you look at the international business, so leaving Hotstar aside, what does your research tell you about what the company needs to do to drive that business meaningfully higher? Because it deliver on your '24 guidance, that's really probably the biggest key is to get that sub base going. So I'm just curious, as you look at the plan, what are the things you think really can make that happen? Thanks, Ben. So on the Disney+ U.S. side, you mentioned that we're roughly 1/3 penetrated. We still have some headroom in each one of our major franchises in terms of those viewers, those fans that have expressed interest in subscribing. So we are not nearly tapped out on each of the major franchises if someone identifies as a Lucas fan, Star Wars or as a Marvel fan or as a Disney fan. The biggest opportunity in terms of significance is with general entertainment being added to the service.  And I think you've seen just this quarter, we mentioned that today that we're adding in Grown-ish, Black-ish and a few other titles into our service. I think that will be a trend of us taking more general entertainment and moving it over to Disney+ because, as you know, about 50% -- slightly over 50% of our consumer base on Disney+ do not have kids. It's a very broad general service, of course, driven by the Disney brand and driven by families, but what we've seen time and time again is that the elasticity of Disney and its brand is much greater than we might have given it credit. And I think nowhere does this play out more, now getting into the international side of your question, than we see in Europe with the Star brand tile being the sixth brand tile within the Disney+ offering in Europe.  The other thing, though, to your question directly on international that's going to drive the international business is the predominance of local content that we are developing in order to appeal to the unique taste of each of those international markets. And I'll point out to the 340 productions that we referenced on the last call that we're developing. And by the way, we just created a new organization within our company to shepherd the development of that content so that we can maximize the chance that we get some global hits, if you will, out of some of that local content. And so we're bullish on the future of Disney+, both domestically and internationally, driven by not only additional prevalence of titles within our major franchises, but also general entertainment and specifically in the international territories local content. That's super helpful, Bob. And just curious, as a follow-up, of those 300 productions or the local originals, will we see a lot of that in fiscal '22 come on the service? Yes. That's the slate that comes on, I think, over the next 1.5 years, next 1.5 years to 2 years. So I don't exactly know the percent that will fall within the context of this year. But we started this initiative about a year ago, and I must say it's actually extraordinary how how great the content is that's being developed in the international territories. Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Going on that same part about international Disney+. Can you talk about what role the sports play, maybe even outside of India? So what are you seeing in Latin America? Does that help close the gap? And in general, how do you consider maybe loss leading with sports versus pulling back on sports and investing in more of your own content? The sports proposition internationally really varies by market. As you know, in Europe, it's not a big component for us, but in Latin America, it actually is. And our -- the way that we've gone to market in each territory, one of the differences between how we go to market in Asia versus how we go to market in Latin America versus how we go to market in Europe is a function of sports. That's a really big piece of it. And where you see like in Latin America where we've got a very big percentage of our consumers that are subscribing to our services because of sports, it's a bigger component to that. Sports for us are -- it's a very important strategic offering because the fandom and the passion is so deep. If you look at India, we're certainly going to try to extend our rights on the IPL. But we're very confident that even if we were not to go ahead and win that auction that we would still be able to achieve our 230 to 260. So it's an important component for us around the world. Obviously really important in India, but not critical to us achieving the 230 to 260 number that we've guided to. Our next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. So Bob, if I could just follow up on that comment on IPL. Hotstar was about 40% of your long-term guide and without cricket, getting to that number seems like a little bit tougher to do, just given the popularity of the sport in the country and also the fact that Hotstar has been in the country for a long time as a localized service. So just wanted to see what bridges that gap to your guidance if -- in the scenario that you don't end up getting Hotstar? And then beyond that, maybe -- sorry, go ahead, Bob. . No, no, go ahead, please. So Christine, from a guidance perspective, I guess the other variable is just a breakeven guidance in 2024 for the streaming service. And you did talk about content spend being at least $8 billion to $9 billion in that year last quarter. So just given the growth in entertainment content locally around the world as well as some of the investments in sports in Latin America and potentially an increase in cost in India, could you just frame what kind of upside we could see to that content spend budget? Any framework in terms of how to think about it would be useful. Bob, do you want to start off on the IPL and Christine can chime in with some more detail on that and the breakeven guidance in content spend? Sure, sure. So while the IPL obviously, is an important part of the Disney+ Hotstar content offering, it's really one component of a broader portfolio of entertainment and sports. In addition to, obviously, the original content and the library content from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and Nat Geo, our Disney+ Hotstar offering does have a massive collection of local content, and we add over 18,000 hours of original programming every year. So while certainly it's an important component, that local content that we're developing really will mitigate the impact of us if we were not to win the auction on IPL. So an important component, but it's not like we see that business evaporating if we don't get it. Christine? Okay. Kannan, on your question on the breakeven guidance and on Disney+ content spend. We're not updating the guidance. We have that fiscal '24 guidance out in the marketplace, and we're sticking to it. We're not yet at a steady state of content expense for Disney+, but we expect to have made significant progress by fiscal 2023. Next question comes from Jessica Reif Erlich with Bank of America Securities. Maybe switching gears to Theme Parks. The leverage in that business is ginormous as we've seen in this quarter. Would you consider the 34% operating income margin peak margin? And then just maybe some color because international visitors really haven't come back, we know they stay longer and spend more. Have you gotten all of the technology improvements that you expect? And within that, with some of the changes that you made in the park, it sounds like you're actually improving capacity. So how should we think about capacity now versus what it was prior to COVID? Christine, do you want that one on the margins? Sure. I would say we've been saying this all along through the pandemic, where we have taken measures to really look at the cost base and how we're doing things. And there's been a fundamental shift in some of the operational processes that the parks had used for many, many years and things like the ability to do mobile dining or not having to check in with the human being at a hotel, those kinds of things are all things that add to upside that we have at the parks. And as you mentioned, Jessica, we haven't yet seen the return of our international guests. And remember, historically, and we always hit this historical boundary of our band of 18% to 22% of our Walt Disney World guests came from outside of the U.S., and they haven’t even yet started to return.  So I think there's a lot of things that are boding well, and we saw the performance this quarter of Genie and at the other things like Lightning Lane, but it's not just that. It's also really compelling offerings in food, beverage, merchandise. And it's really great to see not only creativity in our content business, but creativity at our parks as well. And that's driving some of that incremental spending that's certainly helping the margins get to that level that we've seen this quarter. All right. Thanks for the question, Jessica. The next question comes from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. I believe we're going to be coming up on an anniversary of the first price change that you had for the Disney+ service. And so I was hoping you could give us some insight in terms of how you're thinking about pricing strategy for the product going forward? And what are the key things that influence that in terms of timing, when you bring new content on, distribution partners or anything else we should be thinking about as we model out ARPU? Christine, I'll start with this. And if you want to augment, please do. We maintain that we offer an extraordinary price value relationship around the world for Disney+. Obviously, the last few years, pretty much the entirety of the launch of Disney+ have been plagued by COVID-related production interruptions. Plus in all fairness, our own recognition that we needed to essentially double our production output. You put those 2 things together, and we certainly have less content than we want. But as we've said over the last few earnings calls, that will rectify itself in the second half of this year","['Star Wars', 'Christine McCarthy', 'Kannan Venkateshwar', 'Jenn Kettnich ', 'Bob Chapek', 'Brett Feldman ', 'Ben Swinburne', 'Michael Nathanson', 'Man', 'Operator', 'BenSwinburne', 'Galaxy', 'Jenn Kettnich', 'Jessica Reif Ehrlich']"
