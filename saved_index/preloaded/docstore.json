At the request of LyondellBasell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. Following today\u2019s presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Thank you, operator. Hello and welcome to LyondellBasell\u2019s fourth quarter 2021 teleconference. I am joined today by Ken Lane, our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Michael McMurray, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin the discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today\u2019s call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com/investorrelations. Today, we will be discussing our business results while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risk and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that could lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our regulatory filings, which are also available on our Investor Relations website. Additional documents on our Investor website provide reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with other disclosures, including the earnings release and our business results discussion. A recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1 p.m. Eastern Time today until February 28 by calling 877-660-6853 in the United States and 201-612-7415 outside the United States. The access code for both numbers is 13725132. During today\u2019s call, we will focus on fourth quarter and full year 2021 results, the current environment and our near-term outlook. Before turning the call over to Ken, I would like to call your attention to the non-cash lower of cost or market inventory adjustments, or LCM, that we have discussed on past calls. These adjustments are related to our use of last in, first out, or LIFO, accounting and the volatility in prices for our raw material and finished goods inventories. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we recognized a non-cash impairment of $624 million that reflected our ongoing evaluation of strategic options for the Houston refinery. Comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of the refinery impairment and the LCM inventory adjustments. With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Ken. Thank you, Dave and good day to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today and as we discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results. Before we begin the business discussion, I would like to take a moment and thank our Board of Directors for the opportunity to lead LyondellBasell as Interim CEO until Peter Vanacker can join the company at the end of the second quarter. For the past 30 years, I have worked in the chemical industry in roles spanning manufacturing, major projects, strategy and business leadership with assignments in Asia, Europe and the Americas. Since 2019, I have had the pleasure of leading LyondellBasell\u2019s global Olefins and Polyolefins businesses. Our company is in great shape and we have good momentum. I want to emphasize that our strategy remains unchanged and I will keep our company moving forward, continuing to execute our strategy and ensuring Peter has a successful start. I will work closely with our Board, the LyondellBasell leadership team and our 19,000 talented employees to advance our growth projects, actively manage our business portfolio, and ensure we remain consistent with our goals of being the best operated and most valued company in our industry. Now moving on to the business discussion, as Dave mentioned, a set of slides accompanies today\u2019s call and is available on our website. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 3 and review some highlights for the past year. 2021 earnings were $18.19 per share, with $9.3 billion of EBITDA. Earnings per share were more", "doc_id": "84958426-4dd3-4467-84d9-853a852313e8", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "5e7897b8cdefcc21d9fdd9ef36b47fdb8fba80c29fe467c0158ede31b0e6855d", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 4270, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "3": "ac31f056-9bfe-4363-82ff-ca8f6ef83376"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "ac31f056-9bfe-4363-82ff-ca8f6ef83376": {"__data__": {"text": "per share, with $9.3 billion of EBITDA. Earnings per share were more than 3x higher than 2020 and EBITDA improved by 140%. Our company\u2019s growing portfolio of assets delivered EBITDA that exceeded our previous best year by 15% and resulted in $7.6 billion of cash from operating activities. Altogether, we generated a 25% return on invested capital during 2021. Our results provide an indicator of how LyondellBasell\u2019s earnings power is stepping up relative to the performance we delivered over the prior decade. Our 2021 performance was supported by strong demand for our products, supply constraints across our industry and our growth investments. Favorable markets drove 7 consecutive months of contract price increases for polyethylene in the United States. In our Intermediates and Derivatives segment, strong demand for polyurethanes drove record earnings from our leading propylene oxide and derivatives business. A robust market for building and construction materials served to increase margins across our acetyls value chain. Also, rebounding demand for transportation fuels, self-help cost reductions and higher operating rates enabled our Refining segment to return to profitability in both the third and the fourth quarters. I want to emphasize that we are maintaining our commitment to a disciplined approach to capital allocation. Our team worked diligently to convert our EBITDA into $7.6 billion of cash from operating activities. After investing $1.9 billion to maintain our assets and fund additional profit-generating investments, $5.7 billion of free cash flow remained. We rewarded investors by deploying $4.44 per share in dividends and repurchasing over 5 million shares. Last but not least, we delivered on our commitments and strengthened our balance sheet with $4 billion of long-term debt reduction. Our strategy is to identify, develop and capture opportunities through all phases of business cycles. During 2021, we capitalized on those opportunities. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 4. Our core commitments to health and safety remain steadfast. The tragic incident that resulted in two fatalities and several injuries at our acetic acid plant last July reminds us of why we work so diligently toward our goal of flawless safety performance. We learn from experience and seek to further bolster our GoalZERO work environment to prevent these incidents from recurring. On Slide 4, you can see that during 2021, our team continued to deliver recordable incident rates that are among the lowest for industry. I\u2019m particularly proud of our team\u2019s performance over the final months of 2021 as we engaged the entire organization and leadership teams of our largest contractors to reduce recordable incident rates across our employee and contractor workforce each month during the second half of the year. Now please turn to Slide 5 to review our quarterly profitability. While increased costs for feedstocks and energy continue to compress margins from second quarter highs, demand for our products remain strong. Our business portfolio delivered $2 billion of EBITDA during the fourth quarter, exceeding the results of the prior year quarter by 60%. Increased energy costs were particularly impactful for our European O&P and I&D operations, where on some days in December, Dutch natural gas prices exceeded $50 per million BTU. Higher natural gas prices directly impact our fuel costs, but also show up as higher costs for our purchased electricity and steam. Nonetheless, seasonal patterns for our businesses typically trend downward at the end of the year, and the $2 billion of EBITDA we earned during the fourth quarter of 2021 is reflective of healthy markets for our products. The downward trends we saw in the fourth quarter seem to be abating with margins stabilizing in January. During the remainder of the first quarter, we could see inflection on stronger seasonal demand and supply constraints. With most economists expecting 2022 global GDP growth rates to exceed historical averages at roughly 4%, we remain constructive on the outlook for our businesses. New capacity will come online in 2022 but will largely be needed to meet growing demand from well-funded consumers, address order backlogs as supply chains normalize and support further global", "doc_id": "ac31f056-9bfe-4363-82ff-ca8f6ef83376", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "814b6983496cd44bf8ca4edfa76b15a0b7d78aca842847a72b6d99274853bdec", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 4214, "end": 8490, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "84958426-4dd3-4467-84d9-853a852313e8", "3": "95953cda-a8de-42d0-b0c4-a42b2bd9160b"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "95953cda-a8de-42d0-b0c4-a42b2bd9160b": {"__data__": {"text": "consumers, address order backlogs as supply chains normalize and support further global reopening from the pandemic. Slide 6 provides a historical view of LyondellBasell\u2019s profitability over the past decade. During the period from 2011 to 2019, we delivered an average of $6.7 billion of EBITDA. Our performance in 2021 exceeded the 2015 peak by 15%. While 2021 was a particularly strong year for our core markets, we have confidence that the growth investments we brought online since 2018 will drive a sustainable step-change improvement in our profitability over the next decade. The formation of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment in 2018 provided visibility into LyondellBasell\u2019s sizable legacy compounding business. The businesses we acquired that year from A. Schulman added approximately $200 million in annual EBITDA. Since 2018, the APS segment has been challenged by production constraints in their largest market: plastic compounds used in vehicle production. Despite high consumer demand, automotive production has been held back by COVID-related manufacturing shutdowns and shortages of semiconductors. With global vehicle production expected to rebound by 9% in 2022 and an additional 10% in 2023, we expect to reach higher utilization across our APS segment. Increased capacity utilization will enable the realization of volume-driven synergies. In 2020, we commissioned the first world-scale plant utilizing LyondellBasell\u2019s proprietary Hyperzone technology for high-density polyethylene. We have a long and successful track record of introducing new polyolefin technologies. Each new generation of technology encounters initial challenges, and we are making good progress working through those with our first Hyperzone asset. Our manufacturing and R&D teams have been working diligently to improve reliability. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we decided to bring down the Hyperzone plant and make some modifications. While it\u2019s still early days, we are highly encouraged by the performance of the plant since restarting in December. It\u2019s my expectation that we will realize a greater share of the volume and margin benefits from this investment during 2022. In 2020, we invested and integrated cracker joint ventures in China and Louisiana, where new assets were fully built and generated immediate returns. In 2022, we are starting up 2 new propylene oxide plants, a joint venture in China and a wholly owned asset in Houston that will expand LyondellBasell\u2019s ownership capacity for propylene oxide by nearly 50%. I\u2019m pleased to report that the China plant is already producing on-spec products and rapidly ramping up rates. Our larger PO/TBA facility in Houston is progressing on schedule for start-up during the end of this year. Both propylene oxide facilities are starting up with tight markets and all-time high margins for this intermediate chemical that is essential for the production of polyurethanes and other downstream products. Taken together, our growth investments give us the confidence that we will step up earnings in the current decade. On Slide 7, I would like to highlight how we are also stepping up our progress on sustainability. In April, we introduced our Circulen family of polymers produced using recycled and renewable-based feedstocks that reduce our reliance on fossil-based raw materials. These products are targeted at the rapidly growing market for sustainable plastics. In October, we extended the Circulen brand to the compounds and solutions provided by our APS segment. All of this is part of LyondellBasell\u2019s commitment to annually produce and market 2 million tons of recycled and renewable based polymers by 2030. 2022 will be an exciting year for our proprietary MoReTec advanced recycling technology. In December, our team commissioned upgrades to our pilot facility, enabling us to determine the extent of our technology advantage and guide an investment decision for our first commercial-scale facility. This technology provides LyondellBasell with an opportunity to be a leader in the rapidly growing markets for circular plastics. In late September, we announced accelerated targets and the goal to achieve net zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions from our global operations by 2050. We also increased our 2030 ambition and now aim to reduce absolute", "doc_id": "95953cda-a8de-42d0-b0c4-a42b2bd9160b", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "cdcdb15a4b2093fed11e71c8a59a35770a1857c580eb91073d2e6b119dd54f22", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 8472, "end": 12804, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "ac31f056-9bfe-4363-82ff-ca8f6ef83376", "3": "4a4035bc-650b-485b-9cf1-6e62373b425f"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "4a4035bc-650b-485b-9cf1-6e62373b425f": {"__data__": {"text": "by 2050. We also increased our 2030 ambition and now aim to reduce absolute emissions by 30% relative to a 2020 baseline. In the near-term, we don\u2019t expect significant increases in our overall capital budget as reduced spending associated with the completion of our PO/TBA project in 2022 should offset an increasing share for circular and climate-related investments going forward. With that, I will turn the call over to Michael for him to describe our financial and segment results in more detail. Thank you, Ken and good morning everyone. Please turn to Slide 8 and let me begin by highlighting our substantial cash generation during 2021. LyondellBasell delivered record cash from operations and free cash flow in 2021. Our team worked diligently to efficiently convert 82% of our EBITDA into cash for the year despite increased working capital needs to support higher prices. After accounting for sustaining capital investments, we achieved a 23% free operating cash flow yield relative to our market capitalization. Let\u2019s continue with Slide 9 and review the details of how we deployed all of this cash last year. During 2021, we paid dividends and repurchased shares to provide a total of $2 billion in returns for shareholders. In May, we increased our quarterly dividend by 8%. 2021 represents our 11th consecutive year of annual dividend growth. At the same time, we reduced our long-term debt by $4 billion and further bolstered our balance sheet by paying down $300 million of short-term commercial paper. Net interest expense increased to $510 million, higher than our guidance at the beginning of 2021, largely due to debt extinguishment costs. Our current portfolio supports our solid investment-grade balance sheet, and we do not see the need for additional debt reduction. We ended the year with $1.5 billion of cash and short-term investments and $5.4 billion of cash and available liquidity. Now I\u2019d like to provide an overview of the results for each of our segments on Slide 10. As Ken mentioned, our business portfolio delivered $2 billion of EBITDA during the fourth quarter. Our results reflected strong demand for our products, offset by higher costs for feedstocks and energy, primarily in our O&P Europe, Asia, International, I&D and APS segments. Let\u2019s begin the individual segment discussions on Slide 11 with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins, Americas segment. Fourth quarter 2021 EBITDA was $1.3 billion, $306 million lower than the third quarter. Margins declined on lower pricing for both Olefins and Polyolefins. Olefin results decreased approximately $190 million compared to third quarter 2021 due to margin declines driven by lower ethylene and propylene prices. Although we operated our North American ethylene crackers at 97%, sales volumes remained relatively unchanged as we built inventory to support maintenance downtime planned for the first quarter. Combined polyolefin results were approximately $120 million lower than the third quarter, primarily due to a decrease in polyethylene and polypropylene spreads over monomer. Polyethylene, however, posted record volumes driven by strong demand and increased production from our Hyperzone facility in December. O&P Americas posted record EBITDA of $5.3 billion for the full year, $3.5 billion higher than 2020. Margins increased for both Olefins and Polyolefins as higher product prices outpaced higher cost. Demand for nondurable packaging and consumer goods remained strong and led to increased volumes for both ethylene and polyethylene. Based on increasing seasonal demand and tight industry supply due to higher industry cracker maintenance, we expect robust margins to continue into the first quarter. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 12 and review typical seasonal trends in the U.S. polyethylene market. After tight markets escalated prices over the first three quarters of 2021, declines in polyethylene contract prices during the fourth quarter of last year captured market attention. As illustrated by the green line on the chart, demand typically rises during the first quarter, stabilizes in the second quarter and grows again during the second season of the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, orders for polymers slow due to holiday downtime and as market participants strive", "doc_id": "4a4035bc-650b-485b-9cf1-6e62373b425f", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "71795bd979b1f1089d530ca935a05facfd345eab1f5216e885a66ecd1bef8d36", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 12819, "end": 17106, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "95953cda-a8de-42d0-b0c4-a42b2bd9160b", "3": "4f2ce83e-722b-4ba1-b934-ee975c8d8bdd"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "4f2ce83e-722b-4ba1-b934-ee975c8d8bdd": {"__data__": {"text": "quarter, orders for polymers slow due to holiday downtime and as market participants strive to minimize their year-end inventories. The blue line indicates that polyethylene pricing logically follows these seasonal demand trends. Simply put, lower fourth quarter prices are a common occurrence. In contrast, the industry usually sees a rebound in demand and pricing during the first quarter. Orders increase as customers resume full production. During February and March, export demand often improves following the Lunar New Year holiday. In 2022, industry consultants are forecasting planned maintenance for U.S. ethylene crackers will be 3x higher than normal, with about 15% of U.S. capacity taking maintenance downtime. Similarly, about 10% of European ethylene capacity will be down for maintenance during the first half of 2022. Ethylene cracker outages often constrain downstream polyethylene production. In summary, the confluence of seasonal trends, industry downtime and robust consumer demand should provide support for polyethylene pricing during the first quarter of 2022. Now please turn to Slide 13 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins, Europe, Asia and International segment. Higher cost and lower spreads reduced margins and volumes in our EAI markets, resulting in a fourth quarter EBITDA of $155 million, $319 million lower than the third quarter. Olefins results declined approximately $180 million as margins decreased driven by higher feedstock and energy cost despite higher ethylene and propylene prices. We operate our crackers at a rate of 70% due to planned maintenance. Combined polyolefin results decreased approximately $100 million compared to the prior quarter. Lower seasonal demand drove declines in polyolefin price spreads relative to monomer cost and reduced volumes. Declining polyolefin spreads and higher energy costs also affected our joint venture equity income by about $15 million. Full year EBITDA increased $923 million compared to 2020. Olefins margins declined due to higher feedstock costs, outpacing increased ethylene and propylene prices. Combined polyolefin results and our joint venture equity income increased by more than $815 million and $125 million, respectively, driven by higher margins with increases in polyolefin prices. In Europe, we expect typical seasonal improvements as we progress through the first half of the year. Please turn to Slide 14 as we take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $252 million, a decline of $96 million from the third quarter of 2021. Compressed margins for Oxyfuels & Related Products and last in, first out inventory valuation charges of about $95 million muted margin improvements in our propylene oxide and derivatives and intermediate chemical businesses. Fourth quarter propylene oxide and derivatives results remained relatively unchanged, with higher margins offset by lower volumes due to planned maintenance. Intermediate chemicals results increased about $65 million with the resumption of our acetyls production.  Oxyfuels & Related Products results decreased approximately $85 million as margins declined due to higher butane feedstock costs. For the full year, strong demand and a tight market drove margin increases in most businesses, resulting in EBITDA of $1.4 billion, $535 million higher than 2020. Volumes declined due to reduced exports of our propylene oxide and derivative products. In the first quarter of 2022, we expect margins to improve for our Oxyfuels & Related Products business with lower butane feedstock costs. Our volumes are expected to increase during the first quarter, supported by continued strong demand for our propylene oxide and derivatives and acetyls products. Now let\u2019s move forward and review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 15. Customer supply chain constraints and high raw material costs hindered results with fourth quarter EBITDA of $24 million, $97 million lower than the third quarter. The segment incurred last in, first out inventory valuation charges of about $55 million during the quarter. Results for the Compounding & Solutions businesses decreased due to margin declines driven by higher raw material costs. Volumes decreased with continued supply chain constraints in the automotive manufacturing market. Results for our advanced polymer businesses were relatively", "doc_id": "4f2ce83e-722b-4ba1-b934-ee975c8d8bdd", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "a30b7818a40801be4f9164de70b33f097bda60f6aa8065c99781c5497c2545d9", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 17091, "end": 21508, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "4a4035bc-650b-485b-9cf1-6e62373b425f", "3": "0155a83d-c941-4afd-ab98-03ec2eefabc3"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "0155a83d-c941-4afd-ab98-03ec2eefabc3": {"__data__": {"text": "the automotive manufacturing market. Results for our advanced polymer businesses were relatively unchanged, with margin improvement offset by volume declines. Full year EBITDA for the segment was $409 million, a $28 million increase over 2020. Compared to the prior period, results benefited from a $35 million reduction in integration costs. Margins increased with higher spreads and volumes, increased with higher building and construction demand for our advanced polymer businesses. We expect volumes to improve as automotive manufacturers begin to ramp up production, particularly for products from our Compounding & Solutions business. Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 16 and discuss the results of our Refining segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $150 million, a $109 million improvement compared to the third quarter of 2021. Results excluded a noncash impairment charge of $624 million, reflecting our ongoing evaluation of strategic options. Results for the quarter benefited from approximately $50 million due to LIFO effects from reduced inventory volumes. Results for the fourth quarter were driven by an improvement in margins due to a better product mix and an increase in the Maya 2-1-1 benchmark crack spread to about $23.58 per barrel. We operated the refinery at near-full rates of nameplate capacity with an average crude throughput at 266,000 barrels per day. Full year EBITDA increased $289 million compared to 2020 or breakeven for the year. Comparisons exclude impairments taken in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the third quarter of 2020. Approximately $45 million of LIFO changes benefited the segment for 2021. Refining margins improved with higher demand for gasoline and jet fuel, which drove the Maya 2-1-1 spread from a historically low point in 2020 at an average of $12.63 to $20.87 per barrel in 2021. Crude throughput improved to 231,000 barrels per day in response to higher market demand. Refining margins are expected to improve slightly, with crack spreads estimated to be about $25 per barrel. We plan to operate the refinery at more than 90% of nameplate crude capacity during the first quarter. Please turn to Slide 17 as we review the results of our Technology segment. All-time high levels of licensing revenue and catalyst volumes drove EBITDA to new records of $173 million for the fourth quarter and $514 million for the full year. Based on the timing of anticipated licensing milestones, we expect the first quarter Technology business profitability will be lower, similar to levels in the first quarter of 2021. Before I turn the call over to Ken, let me address some of your annual modeling questions for 2022 on Slide 18. We are planning to invest approximately $2.1 billion in capital expenditures during 2022. Approximately $0.9 billion is targeted toward profit-generating growth projects, with the balance supporting sustaining maintenance. The majority of our 2022 growth investment is associated with the construction of the PO/TBA plant in Houston. We have a fairly typical schedule of planned maintenance for 2022 with a total of three major cracker turnarounds. We will also have a couple of turnarounds in our I&D segment during the second quarter. Based on expected volumes and margins, we estimate that lost production associated with all of this maintenance downtime will impact 2022 EBITDA by approximately $265 million. While routine maintenance costs are expensed, maintenance costs arising from turnarounds of major production units are capitalized and included in our capital expenditure forecast. The U.S. cracker turnaround is scheduled for the La Porte, Texas site in the first quarter and expected it to impact O&P America\u2019s quarterly EBITDA by approximately $125 million. The European cracker turnarounds will occur at our French cracker during the first and second quarters and are smaller cracker in Wesseling, Germany during the third and fourth quarters of 2022. The maintenance is expected to impact O&P EAI quarterly EBITDA by approximately $25 million, $15 million, $10 million, and $10 million in the first through fourth quarters, respectively. Plant maintenance at our butanediol facility in one of our two propylene oxide units located in Channelview, Texas is expected to impact second quarter EBITDA for our Intermediates and Derivatives", "doc_id": "0155a83d-c941-4afd-ab98-03ec2eefabc3", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "000951d3aaf181e3fdd0b2c3d099fb92a74386b8bede40b8c9367097a9f875fc", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 21502, "end": 25815, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "4f2ce83e-722b-4ba1-b934-ee975c8d8bdd", "3": "54d32dee-46de-4c6e-837d-86ec6df63a46"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "54d32dee-46de-4c6e-837d-86ec6df63a46": {"__data__": {"text": "Texas is expected to impact second quarter EBITDA for our Intermediates and Derivatives segment by approximately $80 million. We expect 2022 net interest expense will be approximately $340 million after netting capitalized interest of about $95 million. 2022 book depreciation and amortization is forecasted to be approximately $1.3 billion. We plan to make regular pension contributions in 2022 totaling approximately $70 million with approximately $55 million of pension expense for the year. We currently expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 20% and our cash tax rate to be lower than our ETR. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Ken. Ken? Thank you, Michael. So let me summarize the year\u2019s highlights and our outlook with Slide 19. In 2021, LyondellBasell maintained our disciplined focus on safety, operational excellence and reliability to maximize returns during a year of exceptional markets. Our 2021 results were 15% above prior benchmarks and are indicative of how LyondellBasell\u2019s profitability is stepping up from prior levels. Many of our growth investments are providing returns today with further contributions expected over the next several years. In 2022, we will expand our propylene oxide capacity by 50% with the start of two new plants in China and Texas. We are improving the performance of our Hyperzone polyethylene technology to deliver enhanced product performance for our customers. As supply chains normalize and automotive production begins to catch up with high consumer demand, we anticipate higher volumes and earnings from our APS segment. Also, improving markets for fuels bodes well for our Oxyfuels and Refining businesses. Our disciplined approach carries through to our capital allocation strategy. We\u2019re providing shareholders with increasing returns from higher dividends and the resumption of share repurchases. In 2021, we de-leveraged our balance sheet and demonstrated our commitment to a strong investment-grade credit rating. With our strong credit metrics, we have no near-term need for further de-leveraging. In 2022, about 40% of our capital expenditures will be allocated toward profit-generating projects, including our new propylene oxide facility in Texas. The rapidly growing market for more sustainable plastics represents one of the greatest opportunities that lies ahead for LyondellBasell. We have launched our Circulen brand, and we\u2019re committed to producing and marketing at least 2 million tons of circular and renewable-based polymers by 2030. At the same time, we will reduce our greenhouse gas emissions in line with our commitment to achieve net zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2050. At LyondellBasell, we believe our work in sustainability is both good for our planet and good for our business. In summary, we will continue to execute on our disciplined approach and build on the strong momentum to deliver sustainable value for all of our stakeholders. We\u2019re now pleased to take your questions. Thank you, sir.  Our first question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Thank you very much. Ken, I was curious if you could tell us what your expectation is on the profile of cash flow and usage over the next couple of years. I mean it looks like you\u2019ll have 2 or 3 excess free cash after deviate after CapEx. And along those lines, can you give us a sense of what the options and appetite on the Sasol option are? Sure, Bob. Thank you for your question. Like I said previously, there is no change to our capital allocation strategy. And what I\u2019ll do is just ask Michael to talk a little bit more about the options going forward, and then maybe I\u2019ll come back and talk about Sasol after that. Perfect. Good morning, Bob. I mean a couple of things that I\u2019d say. I think first and foremost, I\u2019d say really good execution by the team in 2021 in converting EBITDA into free cash flow. It was a record year of cash generation both from an operating cash perspective, but also from a free cash flow perspective as well. And we also de-levered the balance sheet by $4 billion last year, which I think is pretty impressive.

And then on top of that last year, we returned $2 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. So as we look forward, we\u2019re expecting another year of strong cash generation. The balance sheet is in great shape, so there is no need to do any further de-levering. Our growth investments are paying dividends, which is good news. Working capital this year should be a source of free cash flow. Last year, it consumed a significant amount of free cash flow. And then CapEx is largely flat year-on-year. It\u2019s our expectation with our current outlook that we will responsibly grow the dividend. As you saw in the fourth quarter and also in the third quarter of last year, buybacks are in the mix. So we restarted buybacks in September of \u201821. And when we see value, we will continue to buy our shares. And from an M&A perspective, you can expect that LyondellBasell is going to continue to operate in a very, very disciplined way. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Ken to give a few comments about Sasol. Yes, Bob. So for Sasol, we\u2019ve commented before that it\u2019s our desire and intent to own the other half of that joint venture. We\u2019re very happy with the partnership. It obviously performed very well in 2021. But of course, there is a buyer and a seller, and our mutual interests are going to have to be aligned in order to be able to come to a conclusion on the transaction. So timing is a little bit hard to predict. But I would still say that it is going to be in the midterm. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Thanks very much. Do you expect your cash balance at the end of the year to be very different from what it is right now? And are cost pressures in your European olefins business in the first quarter greater than what they were in the fourth? Hi. Good morning, Jeff, I\u2019ll take the first question, and I\u2019ll let Ken take the second one. So we ended the year with about $1.5 billion of cash on sheet. I think you heard me just say in my previous answer that we will grow the dividend responsibly. We will buy our shares when we see value. That said, as we move throughout the year, it\u2019s possible that we could build a little bit of additional cash on sheet. And just in terms of the cost pressure in Europe, yes, we saw really an unprecedented spike in energy costs in Europe in the fourth quarter. And we started taking action then to be able to give us a little bit of insulation from that and started to move some surcharges into the market to be able to share some of that burden. So that is going to help us in the first quarter offset some of that. But the cost pressures that we saw in Europe are obviously going to be continuing as you look at the energy prices where they are today. But we\u2019re doing what we can to offset where possible. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Hey, good morning.

After that, we will move to a Q&A session on the results with both Steve and Jeff. With that, let me turn it over to Steve. Thanks Vivian, and good morning everyone. As you saw in our press release a short while ago, we reported strong quarterly and full-year revenue growth in earnings for 2021. Thanks to the efforts of our dedicated and talented colleagues around the globe. We also provided revenue and EPS guidance for 2022 and we announced a new growth plan that resets our longer-term aspirations for revenue and EPS growth, so levels that are higher than what we were delivering in the years before the pandemic. I want to spend my time today talking about why these results and our progress over the last few years has me excited about the future and our aspiration to deliver higher levels of sustainable profitable growth. As we've seen in our results for Q4 and the full-year, the capabilities we've built over the past few years by investing in our customers, our brand, and our talent are helping us drive share, scale and relevance that leads to profitable growth. And we believe that will continue as the global economy continues to improve. Our strong performance across a number of key business metrics help deliver revenue growth of 30% in the fourth quarter and 17% for the full-year. Diluted EPS for the quarter was $2.18 and $10.02 for the full-year. In the near-term, we expect full-year revenue growth to remain at elevated levels, reaching 18% to 20% in 2022 driven by the execution of our growth plan and the recovery tailwinds we anticipate from continued improvement in the macroeconomic environment. We expect EPS of between $9.25 and $9.65 in 2022. As we think about 2023, the continuation of the recovery tailwinds could drive revenue growth in the mid-teens, which in turn should provide a platform for mid-teens EPS growth. Looking further out, as we return to a more steady-state economic environment, we aspire to achieve revenue growth in excess of 10% and EPS growth in the mid-teens under our new growth plan for 2024 and beyond. We've learned a lot over the past few years that we believe will help us achieve our growth plan aspirations. The business imperatives and strategies we focused on pre-pandemic, the decisions we made when COVID-19 first hit to protect our customers and colleagues, and our pivot early in the recovery cycle to ramp up investments in a number of key areas, all proved to be the right moves that have been good for our business. Most importantly, our experience through this period has reinforced our conviction that investing strategically in our customers brand and talent is absolutely critical driving high levels of growth. We've seen that play out in the results we delivered throughout 2021. Our fourth quarter performance continued the trends we saw all year in a number of areas that are core to our growth over the long-term. Spending growth reached a record quarterly high, driven by continued increases in goods and services spending, which was 24% above pre-pandemic levels. Global consumer goods and services spending in the quarter grew 26% versus 2019. And we saw continued robust growth in small business B2B spending, which increased 25% over Q4 2019 levels. Overall T&E spending also continued to improve reaching 82% of pre-pandemic levels, driven by stronger consumer travel spend. Customer retention and satisfaction continue to be very strong and remained above", "doc_id": "df56ce8e-499f-4be6-932e-3cd0af92095a", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "f95b948f7ac0795808feb5a05db7caa999a0bc0be3ae70e1e0b5fb3c169c7ba0", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 33985, "end": 38200, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "cf3ab12d-9b84-4cb2-aaee-222a84b6a651", "3": "b498a3d2-5f7d-4b27-8d48-c18b9b5811f2"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "b498a3d2-5f7d-4b27-8d48-c18b9b5811f2": {"__data__": {"text": "travel spend. Customer retention and satisfaction continue to be very strong and remained above pre-pandemic levels. For example, retention rates in global consumer are above 98%, and for the second year in a row and the 11th time in 15 years, we ranked first in JD Power's Annual Credit Card Satisfaction Study of U.S. consumers. Credit performance also continued to be outstanding with key metrics near historical lows and our card members are building loan balances at a modest pace. Customer engagement with our products, services and capabilities continued at high levels in the quarter. The strong engagement, which is fueled by our ongoing investments in value propositions, marketing and new digital services is helping to drive the results I just spoke about in billings and loan growth as well as customer retention and satisfaction levels. Additionally, our customer-focused innovation strategy, which has driven increases in customer engagement has continued to attract large numbers of new customers. New card acquisitions reached $2.7 million in Q4, driven by strong demand for our premium fee-based products where we saw acquisitions nearly double year-over-year. In consumer, Millennials and Gen-Z customers are driving the growth in acquisitions representing around 60% of the new accounts we acquired globally in 2021. In commercial, Q4 closed out as one of the best years we've ever seen for U.S. SME new account acquisition. The momentum we generated throughout 2021 further strengthens our resolve to continue our focus on the strategic imperatives we laid out back in 2018. Expanding our leadership position in the premium consumer space by providing a differentiated and ever expanding range of services and lifestyle-focused value propositions. Building on our strong leadership position in commercial payments by being the key provider of payments and working capital solutions for small and medium-sized businesses, expanding our merchant network globally to give our card members more places to use their cards and staying on the leading edge of technology and digital payment solutions to make American Express an essential part of our customers' digital lives. We are entering 2022 in a position of strength and based on the momentum with which we exited 2021 and the opportunities we see ahead, we feel very good about the future. We believe that continuing our strategy of investing in high levels in our customers brand and talent as we implement our growth plan will position us well as we seek to achieve our growth aspirations in 2024 and beyond. I'll now turn it over to Jeff to provide more details on our performance for the fourth quarter and our expectations for the future. And after that, we'll take your questions. Thank you. Jeff? Well, thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. It's great to be here to talk about our fourth quarter and full-year 2021 results, the ambitious new growth plan that Steve just talked about, and what it all means for 2022 and beyond. You see the growth momentum that Steve just discussed in our summary financials on Slide 2 with fourth quarter revenues of $12.1 billion, up 31% and full-year revenues of $42.4 billion, up 17%, both on an FX adjusted basis. In understanding our full-year net income of $8.1 billion and earnings per share of $10.02, I would point out that we had around $3.5 billion of significant impacts from items that we do not expect to repeat in the same magnitude going forward, including a $2.5 billion credit reserve release benefit in provision, as well as a few sizable net gains on equity investments. Getting into a more detailed look at our results, let's start with volumes. You will notice in the several views of volumes on Slides 3 through 9 that we continue to show 2021 volume trends on both a year-over-year basis and relative to 2019. There are a few key insights that I would highlight across these slides that strengthen our conviction in the investment strategy we have been focused on to deliver our new growth plan. To start, we saw a record levels of spending on our network in both the fourth quarter and full-year 2021 with total network volumes and billed business volumes, both up more than 10% relative to 2019 on an FX adjusted basis in the fourth quarter, as you can see on Slide 3. This growth in billed business as", "doc_id": "b498a3d2-5f7d-4b27-8d48-c18b9b5811f2", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "3381fd797d6775d2a178f7fbc0d798dd460558f42df37400db35adf04d31efb0", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 38191, "end": 42534, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "df56ce8e-499f-4be6-932e-3cd0af92095a", "3": "21172b9b-42e5-432c-a4a1-86cf3e64e8dd"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "21172b9b-42e5-432c-a4a1-86cf3e64e8dd": {"__data__": {"text": "the fourth quarter, as you can see on Slide 3. This growth in billed business as shown on Slides 4 and 5 is being driven by continued momentum in spending on goods and services, which strengthened sequentially and grew 24% versus 2019 in Q4. This momentum is from the strong growth in online and card-not-present spending that continued throughout 2021, even as offline spending fully recovered and resumed growth, demonstrating the lasting effect of the behavioral changes we've seen during the pandemic. Importantly, this 24% growth versus 2019 in Q4 represents a cumulative growth rate over the past two years that is well above the growth rate we were seeing pre-pandemic. In our consumer business, our focus on attracting and engaging younger cohorts of card members through expanding our value propositions and digital capabilities is fueling the 50% growth in spending from our Millennial and Gen-Z customers you see on Slide 6, and spending from all other age cohorts also showed steady improvement throughout 2021 and exceeded pre-pandemic levels in Q4. Our strategic focus on helping our small and medium-size enterprise clients to run their businesses by expanding the range of products and capabilities that meet their B2B payments and working capital needs, is driving the strong SME spending trends you see on Slide 7. Global SME expanding particularly B2B spending on goods and services has been driving the growth of our commercial billed business throughout 2021 and reached 25% above pre-pandemic levels in Q4. Now turning to T&E spending, you can see on Slide 8 that it continues to recover in line with our expectations, with overall T&E spending reaching 82% of 2019 levels in the fourth quarter. We did see some modest impacts from the Omicron variant in T&E spending as the pace of recovery slowed a bit in December. But even with that modest slowdown, U.S. consumer T&E was not only fully recovered in the fourth quarter, but actually grew 8% above 2019 levels. On balance, the T&E trends we have seen throughout 2021 reinforce our view that travel and entertainment spending will eventually fully recover, but at varying paces across customer types and geographies, and we remain focused on maintaining our leadership position in operating -- offering differentiated travel and lifestyle benefits to our consumer and commercial customers as they return to travel. Finally, on Slide 9, you see that our billed business momentum continues to be led by the U.S., where spending improved sequentially throughout 2021 and grew 16% above 2019 levels in the fourth quarter. International billed business has also shown continued steady though smaller improvement with spending almost fully recovered in Q4. Importantly though, growth in goods and services spending continues to be strong both in the U.S. and outside of U.S. So, what do all of these takeaways mean for 2022 and beyond? Most importantly, we expect the strong momentum in goods and services spending to continue given the investments we've made in premium card member engagement, Prospect acquisition, value propositions that particularly appeal to our Millennial Gen-Z and SME customers, growing our coverage and expanding relationships with key partners. For T&E, we expect the total global consumer and SME T&E spending will be fully recovered by the end of 2022 led by the growth in the U.S. The recovery will be slower for the International and cross-border components of the spend, we've also long said that large and global corporate T&E spending would be the last to recover across our customer types. So these spending types may represent a steady tailwind in both '22 and 2023 as they gradually recover. Moving on to receivable and loan balances on Slide 10, we are seeing good sequential growth in our lending balances that is led by spending. And so the portion of our lending balances that are revolving is recovering more slowly. Because our balances are spend-driven, we do expect to continue to see a strong rebound with loan balances surpassing 2019 levels in 2022, but we expect it to take more time for the interest-bearing portion of these balances to", "doc_id": "21172b9b-42e5-432c-a4a1-86cf3e64e8dd", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "3cbe469a986fa4346196a9f9034d8d04eb4bc0491fa9ea9c0c7595d0a2ba9c91", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 42552, "end": 46706, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "b498a3d2-5f7d-4b27-8d48-c18b9b5811f2", "3": "700e5ab3-ba17-47c1-b5d8-e6755a266333"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "700e5ab3-ba17-47c1-b5d8-e6755a266333": {"__data__": {"text": "but we expect it to take more time for the interest-bearing portion of these balances to rebuild as paydown rates continue to remain elevated due to the liquidity and strength amongst our customer base. Turning next to credit and provision on Slides 11 through 13, as you flip through these slides, there are a few key points I'd like you to take away. Most importantly, we continue to see extremely strong credit performance with card member loans and receivables, write-off and delinquency rates remaining around historical lows. As loan balances begin to rebuild more meaningfully, we do expect delinquency and loss rates to slowly move up over time, but we expect them to remain below pre-pandemic levels in 2022. This strong credit performance combined with continued improvement in the macroeconomic outlook throughout 2021 drove a $1.4 billion provision expense benefit for the full-year, as the low write-offs were fully offset by the reserve releases as shown on Slide 12. As you see on Slide 13, we ended 2021 with $3.4 billion of reserves, representing 3.7% of our loan balances and 0.1% of our card member receivable balances respectively. This is well below the reserve levels we had pre-pandemic given the strong credit performance we've seen. In 2022, we will be growing over the $2.5 billion reserve release benefit we saw in 2021, since I would not expect to see reserve releases of the same magnitude going forward. In fact, depending on credit trends and the pace at which our balance sheet grows, it's possible we may need to build some modest level of reserves. Moving next to revenues on Slide 14. Total revenues were up 30% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, up 17% for the full-year. This is well above our original expectations for the year, driven by the successful execution of our investment strategy and it is part of what emboldens us to launch our new growth plan. Before I get into more details about our largest revenue drivers in the next few slides, I would note that other fees and commissions and other revenue were both up year-over-year in the fourth quarter and for the full-year, primarily driven by the uptick in travel-related revenues we began to see in the second half of 2021. These travel-related revenue still remain well below 2019 levels, however and their complete recovery will likely lag and be a tailwind into 2023 along with International and cross-border travel. Turning to our largest revenue line, discount revenue, on Slide 15, you see it grew 36% year-over-year in Q4 and 25% for the full-year on an FX adjusted basis. This growth is primarily driven by the momentum in goods and services spending we saw throughout 2021. Net card fee revenues have grown consistently throughout the pandemic and for the full-year of 2021 were up 10% year-over-year and up 28% versus 2019 as you can see on Slide 16. The resiliency of these subscription-like revenues demonstrates the impact of the investments we've made in our premium value propositions and the continued attractiveness of those value propositions to both prospects and existing customers. As a result, I expect net card fee growth to accelerate from these already high growth rates in 2022. Turning to net interest income on Slide 17, you can see that it was up 11% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. This is the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, as we clearly hit an inflection point in the second half of 2021. The growth in net interest income is slower than the growth in lending AR due to the strong liquidity demonstrated by our customers that I spoke about earlier, which is leading to both our historically low credit costs and to high paydown rates that are driving lower net interest yields and a slower recovery in revolving loan balances.  Looking ahead, we expect net interest income to be a tailwind to our revenue growth in 2022 and likely 2023 due to the slower recovery in revolving loan balances. So, to sum up on revenues. The successful execution of our investment strategy has driven the revenue recovery momentum, you see on", "doc_id": "700e5ab3-ba17-47c1-b5d8-e6755a266333", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "3c629993f4e4285c0c764c1c82936d2d44a014c2dbaeb26c1b81415afe29b89d", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 46699, "end": 50783, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "21172b9b-42e5-432c-a4a1-86cf3e64e8dd", "3": "5ff899ee-6552-454a-8ae7-bb376fcc5ef0"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "5ff899ee-6552-454a-8ae7-bb376fcc5ef0": {"__data__": {"text": "our investment strategy has driven the revenue recovery momentum, you see on Slide 18. Looking forward into 2022, we expect to see revenue growth of 18% to 20% driven by the continued strong growth in spend in card fee revenues and the lingering recovery tailwinds from net interest income and travel-related revenues. The revenue momentum we saw in 2021 was clearly accelerated by the investments we made in marketing, value propositions, technology and people and those investments show up across the expense lines you see on Slide 19. Starting with variable customer engagement expenses at the top of Slide 19, there are a few things to think about. Most importantly, the investments we are making in our premium value propositions are resonating with our customers and this of course is driving growth in these expense lines. In addition, over the course of the pandemic, we added some temporary incremental benefits to many of our premium products in an effort we refer to as value injection because our customers were not able to take advantage of many of the travel-related aspects of our value propositions. The cost of this value injection effort generally showed up in the marketing expense line. Throughout 2021, we gradually wound down the value injection offers as our customers were again engaging more with the travel aspects of our value propositions, as well as with the new rewards and benefits we introduced through recent product refreshes. This is all a good thing in terms of our long-term customer retention and growth prospects. It does however mean you see more year-over-year growth in these variable customer engagement costs. Putting all these dynamics together, I'd expect the variable customer engagement costs overall to run at around 42% of total revenues in 2022. Moving to the bottom of the slide, operating expenses were just over $11 billion for full-year 2021 and in line with 2020. In understanding our OpEx results however, it's important to point out that we've benefited from $767 million in net mark-to-market gains in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio in 2021 and that these gains are reported in the OpEx line. We also increased investments in critical areas of technology and our talented colleague base in 2021 and expect to continue to grow our investments in these areas this year. For 2022, we expect our operating expenses to be a bit over $12 billion and we see these costs as a key source of leverage relative to our much higher level of revenue growth. Last, our effective tax rate for 2021 was around 25% and I'd expect a similar effective tax rate in 2022 absent any legislative changes. Turning next to our marketing investments, we are making to build growth momentum, you can see on Slide 20 that we invested around $1.6 billion in marketing in the fourth quarter and $5.3 billion for the full-year as we continue to ramp up new card acquisitions while winding down our value injection efforts. We acquired 2.7 million new cards, up 54% year-over-year. Steve emphasized the critical point, however, that in particular, we see great demand for our premium fee-based products with new accounts acquired on these products almost doubling year-over-year and representing 67% of the new accounts acquired in the quarter. Acquisitions of new U.S. consumer and small business Platinum Card members were all-time highs this year with Q4 being a record quarter of new account acquisitions for both of these refresh products. Much more importantly though than just the total number of cards, we focus internally on the overall level of spend and fee revenue growth we bring on from these new acquisitions. We are pleased to see that the revenues from 2021's acquisitions are trending significantly stronger than what we saw pre-pandemic. Looking forward, we expect to spend around $5 billion in marketing in 2022. Turning next to capital on Slide 21, we returned $9 billion of capital to our shareholders in 2021 including common stock repurchases of $7.6 billion and $1.4 billion in common stock dividends on the back of a starting excess capital position and strong earnings generation.

As a result, we ended the year with our CET1 ratio back within our target range 10% to 11%. In Q1 2022, another sign of our growing confidence in our growth prospects, we expect to increase our dividend by around 20% to $0.52 and to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while supporting our balance sheet growth. That brings me to our growth plan on Slide 22 and then we'll open up the call for your questions. The combination of our pre-pandemic strategies, our learnings from the pandemic and the strong momentum we have achieved have all come together to embolden us to announce our new growth plan. What does that mean financially? In the near-term, we expect our revenue growth to be significantly higher than our long-term aspiration due to the range of pandemic recovery tailwinds that I've talked about throughout my remarks, which is why we have given 2022 guidance of 18% to 20% revenue growth. We've also given EPS guidance for 2022 of $9.25 to $9.65. We feel good about this earnings guidance, as the momentum we have built on the revenue side helps us to grow over the number of notable items that benefited our 2021 results that we certainly don't expect to repeat in the same magnitude in 2022, as I discussed the very beginning of my remarks this morning. Our 2022 guidance does assume an economy that will continue to improve and reflects what we know today about the regulatory and competitive environment. It also assumes that based on current exchange rates, we would not see a significant impact from FX on our reported revenue growth in 2022. In 2023, we expect our revenue growth to remain above our long-term aspirational targets to go to due to the lingering recovery tailwinds which should create a platform for producing mid-teens EPS growth. Longer-term, as we get to a more steady-state macro environment, we have an aspiration of delivering revenue growth in excess of 10% and mid-teens EPS growth on a sustainable basis in 2024 and beyond. In closing, we are committed to executing against our new growth plan and will be running the company with a focus on achieving our accelerated growth aspirations. With that, I will turn the call back over to Vivian. Thank you, Jeff. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will now open the line for questions. Alan? . Our first question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Hey, good morning everyone. Hey Ryan. Good morning Ryan. So it's good to hear about the better-than-expected 2024 plus long-term aspirations for in excess of 10% revenue growth and mid-teens EPS growth. So Steve, I would maybe talking -- hoping you could maybe just talk about what is allowing you to drive this better structural growth, is it the investments you're making, the brand resonating more with investors, and what are the key drivers and clearly you're investing heavily in the near-term. Jeff mentioned higher variable engagement costs. Can you maybe just talk about what should give investors' confidence that as we get to 2024, the business going to be able to drive operating leverage versus historically a view of reinvesting a lot into the business. And just lastly, one point of clarification, Jeff. Can you just clarify the platform for mid-teens EPS growth, were you mentioning that you expect mid-teens in '23 or more than it was positioning you well for mid-teens within '24? Thanks. Well, maybe we work backwards. Steve I'll take the last one. Okay. I think the language on 2023 around EPS growth, Ryan, is meant to make the point that we are certainly, given the tailwind is going to drive again very high revenue growth and that creates a great platform for steady earnings growth. The caution there is just, you still have some volatility in how credit reserves may play out. And so when you think about sort of the total level of earnings in 2022 and '23, I feel pretty confident. Could you have some result that", "doc_id": "0f1059bc-0b2c-419c-b342-2cdc4af8943e", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "1ad1135fbe9e5721e637dc445298debefe2fcd5a9692f019118f7de0ec617717", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 55012, "end": 59095, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "5ff899ee-6552-454a-8ae7-bb376fcc5ef0", "3": "fb2c86e7-60d2-42cc-b100-603767e7ed06"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "fb2c86e7-60d2-42cc-b100-603767e7ed06": {"__data__": {"text": "in 2022 and '23, I feel pretty confident. Could you have some result that moves reserve releases between one year and another which skew the actual year-over-year growth number a bit, you might, but I think the core earnings power will be there given the high revenue growth that Steve is going to talk about next. Yes. But just to talk about the operating leverage for a second too, because when you look at and Jeff mentioned that we had sort of the contract to operating expense with the venture gains this year. When you look at that, you will have operating expense leverage growth this particular year because you're looking at 18% to 20% revenue growth. And if you sort of normal -- even if you don't normalize it, you're going to have a much higher revenue growth and you will. So we're still going to drive operating expense growth throughout this -- throughout our journey. But let me talk to you about what gives me the confidence and when I look at sort of what we've done over the last four years, where we are now and how we're exiting, what I would sum this up, is it's a combination of three things. It is the strategy that we put in place. It is the secular tailwinds that we have and the momentum. I'm going to start from the back and work my way forward. Look at the moment, I mean you've got 30% revenue growth in this particular quarter, you got 2.7 million cards that we acquired, you've got historically high billings growth, we haven't gotten into this, but we see travel bookings. When we looked at travel bookings in the fourth quarter, it was 24% up over '19. When we look at the first couple of weeks in January, we're 44% up over '19. So we have tremendous momentum entering 2022 and I'll move to the beginning go to strategy. We at the -- back in 2018 and I made this in my remarks, we talked about being the premium card provider. And I think the skepticism was from Millennials and Gen-Z, that skepticism from my perspective is over, 60% of the cards that we acquired are Millennials and Gen-Z in this quarter; 75% of our premium cards were Millennials and within the next strategic imperative was SME. We had probably the best SME acquisition year that we've ever had. We talked about our ability to be in people's digital lives with 31% online spending growth over 2019. And we had 16% online spending growth just over last year and look at what we've done from a merchant perspective, we're parity in the U.S. and we added over 7 million merchants, just last year internationally, and then look at the secular tailwinds. I think the pandemic has moved online spending forward for three years to five years and we're getting more than our fair share. And then look at our business, we're at 82% of the overall T&E business from 2019. Now, consumers doing really well, in the fourth quarter, we were up 8%, but the rest of it is below 2019 levels. And so we believe from a T&E perspective, we've got more room to go. When we look at our, as we segment our card members, Millennials are blowing it out. We had over 50% spending from Millennials in our Gen and Gen-Z increased over both 2019 and 2020 and as we look at sort of our Gen-X is up and our boomers are not and our boomers traditionally hit once they travel and have money and once we get from pandemic to endemic here, they're going to start traveling again. Jeff talked about modest loan balances that will grow over time, which is the comment he made about some reserve increases, but we're going to get back to where we were, we look at international consumer. International consumer tends to be a more traveling card member and that business is flat and large and global has not come back and I'll leave you with this on large and global. People are skeptical about business travel because of all the remote workforce. In fact, I think business travel is going to be completely different. And I think as you have more people in more remote locations, they may need to get together three, four, maybe five times a year to come to headquarters or to come to locations where they never had to come to before. And let's face it, we all realize that there", "doc_id": "fb2c86e7-60d2-42cc-b100-603767e7ed06", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "99a62ee353d61edb833942c3ae89fbdf129f00e4738c7fed7a7b056a58ae281e", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 59100, "end": 63246, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "0f1059bc-0b2c-419c-b342-2cdc4af8943e", "3": "c4af52c5-2109-4f18-ae36-004c22db6430"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "c4af52c5-2109-4f18-ae36-004c22db6430": {"__data__": {"text": "they never had to come to before. And let's face it, we all realize that there is nothing better than sit in front of your customers. And I just came back from an opportunity at the Amex Golf Tournament to sit in front of a lot of my customers. So when we look at the secular tailwinds, that's why we believe it's not only doable but sustainable as we move forward. Thanks for taking my questions and apologize for packing so many in there. Alan? Our next question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Hi, good morning. Hi, good morning. Good morning to you Betsy. I just wanted to dig in a little bit more on some of the opportunities that you were discussing. I mean when I sit from my seat, I'm wondering what type of penetration do you think you have in the U.S. Millennial and Gen-Z, the numbers you just quoted were very impressive, but I'm wondering do you feel you're at 90% of that market or 10%. Give us a sense as to how you're thinking about that. And in addition, on the SME side where you're the clear leader, where is the room for you to run, is it by increasing the product set, i.e. the revolving line of credit that you recently announced or is it more in acquiring new customers and really the question is what's the TAM and what percentage of that TAM do you think you have right now in the various customer sets? Thanks. So let me start, Jeff can sort of jump in. Look, from a Millennial perspective, I don't know exactly where we are. But what I can tell you is we're not at the 90%. I'd be closer to the 10% than the 90% but Millennials and Gen-Z. So I think there's a lot of opportunity and a lot of runway and maybe in Investor Day, we'll try and give you some guidance on that and we'll do a little bit of work on that. From an SME perspective, look, we are -- that's right, we are the clear leader from an SME perspective. And I think when you look at the opportunity set, what we've said from an SME perspective is we want to be the total working capital providers and so you look at what we've done. What we've done is we've gone out there and now we've created with the acquisition of Kabbage we've created our we have the checking account, we have the debit card, and checking account is important because that's where all the flows of money come in and go out. From a card perspective, we've always been in great shape. From a revolver perspective on the card, we don't have the same share that we've had, and so we'll push a little bit more on that revolver obviously on working capital loans and some of the other term loans, we will be pushing on as well. So we think when you put that together holistically, we have a lot of room for growth from an SME perspective not only in the U.S., but in international where we leverage our international corporate card business and our position from a small consumer perspective to go after it. So, we think both of those areas are still very, very right to grow. Our next question will come from the Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. Go ahead please. Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Hey Mihir. I just wanted to as, ['Mihir Bhatia', 'Vivian Zhou', 'Stephen Squeri', 'Betsy Graseck', 'Ryan Nash', 'Jeff Campbell', 'Operator']\n2, VZ, 4, 2021, 2022-01-25 12:46:06, Good morning, and welcome to the Verizon Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation.  Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Brady Connor, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thanks Brad.

As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussions of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. As a reminder, we are still in the quiet period for the 3.45 gigahertz spectrum auction so we will not be able to comment on our mid-band spectrum holdings or strategy. Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the fourth quarter and full year. In the fourth quarter, we reported earnings of $1.11 per share, resulting in full year earnings of $5.32 per share on a GAAP basis. Reported fourth quarter earnings include a net pretax loss from special items of approximately $1.2 billion. This includes a charge of $2.4 billion for the early extinguishment of debt, a $106 million charge related to severance, a $1.2 billion credit pertaining to the annual mark-to-market for our pension and OPEB liabilities and a net gain of $131 million primarily related to the disposition of an investment. Excluding the effect of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.31 in the fourth quarter and $5.39 for the full year. We completed the acquisition of TracFone on November 23. The revenue associated with TracFone this year was approximately $700 million higher than the revenue received from TracFone in the fourth quarter of 2020. All of this revenue flows through our Consumer Group. As noted in our press release this morning, beginning in 2022, our adjusted earnings per share will exclude amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. For 2021, such intangible amortization negatively impacted adjusted earnings per share by approximately $0.11. And for 2022, we anticipate the impact to be approximately $0.17 to $0.19. Finally, we will be hosting our Annual Investor Day event on March 3 in New York City, where our leadership team will provide further details on our company's exciting plans for this year and beyond. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans to take us through a recap of 2021. Thank you, Brady, and happy new year to all of you. This past week has been one of the best since I joined Verizon. On January 19, we successfully launched 5G Ultra Wideband on C-band, which will enable more Americans than ever before to experience a transformative speed, reliability and power of our multipurpose network on the go, in their home or for their businesses. Our work throughout 2021 brought us to this moment, and I will spend this call discussing how we got here and how our accomplishment will accelerate our growth. I want to thank our incredible V team for all your hard work and dedication throughout 2021 and for delivering for our customers and our communities. We have never executed so well on so many strategic and operational objectives as we did in 2021. This was a catalyst via Verizon, and I'm very proud of our work. We have a clear and disciplined strategy based on our multipurpose network that creates economies of scale and new business models in an era where broadband is essential to our customers and society. Our results clearly confirm that our strategy is working and that 2021 was a transformative year for Verizon, and it clearly sets us up for a high impact year in 2022. We have now assembled the industry's most comprehensive portfolio of high-quality assets, leveraging our best-in-class technology to extend our network leadership to address more opportunities than anyone else in the market. We're widely being recognized for both what we have accomplished and", "doc_id": "6d1d5e0e-4489-472c-a204-51a59ecd42ab", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "03c43a46be19228e80d3ef708a130147d1ce0cdf08fdacbdac852c3d46c36b6f", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 67174, "end": 71455, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "c4af52c5-2109-4f18-ae36-004c22db6430", "3": "1f5c90ce-2040-42a6-a610-ced3276548da"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "1f5c90ce-2040-42a6-a610-ced3276548da": {"__data__": {"text": "in the market. We're widely being recognized for both what we have accomplished and for the 28th time in a row, J.D. Power ranked Verizon first for network quality. This is our 175th J.D. Power Network Quality Award in 18 years. At the same time, we continue to support our four stakeholders: shareholders, customers, employees and society as a responsible business. Verizon leads the industry in sustainability. We are ranked ahead of our peers, both by the Drucker Institute and JUST 100, and we are confident that our multi-stakeholder strategy will lead to long-term shareholder value. We have a team and expertise to lead the country into a vibrant mobile computing future. Verizon has the best engineers in the world, and they have built a world forward reliable and scalable network. This asset is the foundation and the catalyst for our accelerating growth. So we begin 2022 with a strong portfolio of assets. We're executing our 5G strategy, making great progress on our five vectors of growth and delivering a premier customer experience. This significant momentum sets us up for 2022 and beyond. Let me give an update on the financial and operation metrics. During 2021's first quarter, we set clear targets. As we close out 2021 and enter in 2022, I'm proud to report that we delivered on all of them plus some, and our achievements will only capitalize even greater value creation in 2022. On our January 19 C-band deployment, we covered more than 90 million POPs and millions of homes in more than 1,700 cities, well ahead of plan on making excellent use of the incremental capital spend to augment and accelerate our business opportunities. Today, we cover more than 95 million POPs as the team is progressing also brought more than 15,000 additional 5G Ultra Wideband small cells in service, exceeding our annual goal and nearly doubling our total 5G millimeter wave presence, increasing our fiber footprint to create a state-of-the-art multipurpose network. At our Investor Day last year, we said we would have 5% to 10% traffic in urban areas covered by millimeter wave. Today, we're almost at 10%, it's exceeding our expectation. This confirms our millimeter wave strategy. All this had stage for last week's Verizon Ultra Wideband launch. We're excited and pleased with what we have seen so far from customer reception to network performance. We have grown our network significantly. We finished 2021 with over 20 million households covered for our fixed wireless access solutions and T-band adds millions more homes. For business, our initial C-band expansion will recover more than 1.7 million organizations with Verizon 5G business Internet across 900 cities. We will reach new retail and business clients by offering a breadth of plan options that make our capabilities relevant to their lives. Our new mix and match 4.0 offerings allow customers to pick the 5G plan they want with options for savings on home Internet. For businesses, we offer business unlimited offerings that bring choice and power to the professional market. In addition to our network achievements, we closed on two large strategic transactions in 2021. We sold Verizon Media Group to Apollo Global Management for $5 billion in a transaction that closed in September, retaining minority ownership. And in November, we completed our strategic acquisition of TracFone, positioning Verizon as the number one provider within the value segment. This opportunity enables us to deepen our relationship with new customers while delivering more enhanced services. TracFone is being rapidly integrated into our operation. The acquisition added 20 million customers to our prepaid model and cements Verizon as a leading prepaid vendor at Walmart and Best Buy forming a strong foundation of our retail efforts. We also continue to reach new customers through bundled Internet telephone and television services. Fios Internet adds in 2021 were our best since 2014, and we continue to expand availability of the best-in-class service. Importantly, we strengthened our relationship with our customers adding more connections, including more than 0.5 million new wireless postpaid phone net adds, while maintaining and cultivating our loyal, high-quality relationships.

We provided additional value for our customers through our unique partnership strategy with the best brands that are meaningful to people, lives and businesses. This includes content partnership with NFL, Disney, Apple, Discovery and Niantic to name a few. For businesses, we offer mobile edge compute capabilities, something we're first in the world with alongside industry leaders like AWS, Google and Microsoft. Disruptions to consumer and industrial supply chains throughout 2021 and extending into this year have affected all industries and brought digital connectivity to the central focus in the lives of our stakeholders. That said, Verizon has executed effectively under discussion as demonstrated by our successful network expansion and network service launches. Once again, our financial performance demonstrates our strategy is working. Our focus on profitable volume continues to drive wireless service revenue growth of 4.7% in 2021. And in the fourth quarter, 74% of our customers subscribed to an unlimited plan compared to 71% in Q3. Just over one-third of our unlimited subscribers have unlimited premium. This leaves room for continued step-up expansion. Our multipurpose network and flexible plans will also help customers to upgrade handsets and devices. We saw quick adoption of 5G handsets throughout 2021 in anticipation of new services. One-third of our customers' handsets are now 5G-enabled compared to about 25% in the third quarter. We raised our earnings per share and wireless service revenue guidance during the year and deliver on both including 10% EPS growth. We promised also $10 billion in cost savings, and we deliver ahead of schedule. However, we continuously strive to more efficiently manage our business. We generated strong cash flows to support our investments and financial commitment, and we delivered our 15th consecutive year of increased dividend payments while maintaining a healthy balance sheet. As for our focus on ESG, Citizen, Verizon has also delivered on its promises. We took action towards meeting our 2025 goals, including spending to support technology education and adoption to bridge digital divide and contracting for significant renewable energy capacity, positioning the Company to achieve over 50% renewable energy goal by 2025. Matt will highlight on our performance and 2022 guidance in detail. But we will target organic service and other revenue of around 3% as well as EBITDA growth of 2% to 3%. With the right assets in place and a sound strategy to reach consumers and businesses with 5G capabilities and mobile edge computing on our multipurpose network, Verizon has unlimited potential. 2022 will demonstrate this. Now, I will turn the call over to Matt to walk you through our fourth quarter and full year performance in greater detail. Thank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be with you today to share our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results where we continue to deliver strong financial and operating performance. Before I get into the 2021 results, let me add my own congratulations to the Verizon team for achieving our C-band build targets well ahead of schedule and for the successful commercial launch week. The C-band deployment provides so many opportunities for us. As Hans mentioned, our strategy is working and these results demonstrate our ability to compete effectively to drive new high-quality customers to our platforms while also serving our best-in-class customer base. We do this with the financial discipline that enables us to deliver attractive service revenue growth and profitability as evidenced by another strong earnings performance with healthy cash generation. It starts with our award-winning networks, which enable both our consumer and business organizations to deliver the best products, services and experiences to customers. With the acquisition of TracFone, the deployment of C-band spectrum, new mix and match plans, and the strongest and most innovative team in the industry, 2022 is positioned to be our best year yet. Let's take a look at these results beginning on Slide 6. In the fourth quarter, consolidated total revenue was $34.1 billion, down 1.8% from the prior year. Adjusting for the sale of Verizon Media Group on September 1, consolidated revenue grew 4.8%, strong wireless service revenue", "doc_id": "fd4c79d6-344b-40a0-b968-ed62fd5f87e0", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "95acc1a2b1d82a1c1f48f94e05593ca84cb951ce3e2b6e97a1dac354910b4257", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 75731, "end": 80132, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "1f5c90ce-2040-42a6-a610-ced3276548da", "3": "6c27518e-16d3-4894-b1b0-4c2024e90f77"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "6c27518e-16d3-4894-b1b0-4c2024e90f77": {"__data__": {"text": "September 1, consolidated revenue grew 4.8%, strong wireless service revenue growth and wireless equipment revenue were offset by continued declines in legacy wireline products. Total wireless service revenue was up 6.5% for the quarter. The results were driven by a combination of ARPA and volume growth, consistent with our strategy and the contribution from the TracFone acquisition. For the full year, wireless service revenue grew 4.7%, including TracFone, and was in line with the increased guidance we provided at the end of the third quarter when adjusted for the TracFone acquisition. Total Fios revenue was $3.2 billion and grew 5.7% for the fourth quarter, driven by strong customer demand for our high-quality connectivity services. Full year FiOS revenue was approximately $12.7 billion, up 4.6% over the prior year. Service and other revenue grew 2.6% in the fourth quarter, excluding the impact of the sale of Verizon Media, while on a reported basis it declined 5.4% from the prior year. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $11.8 billion, relatively flat compared to last year as growth in consumer was offset by declines in business and the impact of the Verizon Media Group sale. Full year consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled $48.4 billion, up 2.8% from the prior year. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.2% down 50 basis points primarily due to higher equipment revenues. Earlier in the year and ahead of schedule, we achieved our $10 billion business excellent cost savings goal. We continue to drive efficiency in the business while operating with the best cost structure in the industry and expect strong operating leverage as we execute across all of our five vectors of growth. As Brady mentioned, for the fourth quarter, adjusted EPS was $1.31, up 8.3% year-over-year, demonstrating the strength of our business. For the full year, adjusted EPS of $5.39 was at the high end of our upwardly revised guidance range and is a 10% increase over 2020 results. Now let's take a look at our consolidated metrics. The strength of our networks and brand, combined with our effective go-to-market strategy are driving improved competitive performance in the market. We continue to expand our high-quality mobility base with strong performance across consumer and business. At the same time, accelerating fixed wireless sales are complementing strong Fios results, expanding our broadband growth opportunity. For the quarter, we delivered 558,000 wireless retail postpaid phone net adds, an increase over the 279,000 achieved during the same period last year. Postpaid phone churn for the quarter was 0.81%, roughly in line with the same period last year and better than pre-pandemic levels, reflecting the enduring loyalty of our customer base through ordinary and extraordinary times. Total broadband net adds, which includes consumer and business Fios, DSL and fixed wireless totaled $106,000, up 30,000 from the prior year. Fios Internet net adds were 55,000, another strong result. Even with a slight uptick in voluntary churn, we continue to experience exceptionally low Fios Internet churn as customers trust the reliability of our network and the simplicity of our mix and match pricing. Our full year Internet net adds of 360,000 represented the best annual performance in 2014, and we now have 6.9 million Fios Internet customers. Demand for our fixed wireless access services continue to grow even before our C-band deployment. FWA net adds, which include both consumer and business fixed wireless products, totaled 78,000, up from 55,000 last quarter. This brings our total FWA customer base to approximately 223,000 at the end of the year. Now let's turn to our consumer group results. Fourth quarter represented another strong financial performance for consumer, highlighted by our best Fios revenue growth in the 2.0 area, wireless service revenue momentum and healthy profitability. We are clearing the benefits of our focused go-to-market organization. Consumer operating revenue for the fourth quarter was $25.7 billion, up 7.4% year-over-year. Service and other revenue of $19.4 billion was up 5.2% versus the", "doc_id": "6c27518e-16d3-4894-b1b0-4c2024e90f77", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "51cfa5c4b5ff48c4f47e18fde88228f323d960f6d7dd56634de63a4f0158fdd5", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 80146, "end": 84306, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "fd4c79d6-344b-40a0-b968-ed62fd5f87e0", "3": "206d142c-286c-4cf1-9702-76e99bc661ca"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "206d142c-286c-4cf1-9702-76e99bc661ca": {"__data__": {"text": "Service and other revenue of $19.4 billion was up 5.2% versus the prior year due to strong wireless and Fios revenue growth and a partial quarter contribution from TracFone. As Brady mentioned, the net revenue change from TracFone was approximately $700 million in the quarter, which included incremental service revenue of approximately $500 million year-over-year. For the full year, total Consumer revenue increased 7.6% from a year ago to $95.3 billion, and service and other revenue rose 3.4% to $75.5 billion. Consumer wireless service revenue for the quarter rose 7.7% to $14.6 billion, reflecting ongoing step-ups into unlimited and premium plans as well as the contribution from TracFone. Postpaid ARPA increased 3.2% from the year ago period driven by a higher premium unlimited mix and growth in products and services, such as content, cloud and device protection plans. For the full year, Consumer wireless service revenue was $56.1 billion, up 4.7% from 2020 levels. Consumer Fios revenue totaled $2.9 billion for the fourth, quarter up 5.6% from the year-ago period driven primarily by the strong growth in our broadband base. For the quarter, EBITDA was $10.3 billion, up 4.1% year-over-year or more than $400 million, driven by the service revenue growth. Margins were 40.3%, down 20 basis points from last year due to higher equipment revenues associated with increased volumes. For the full year, EBITDA was $41.6 billion up approximately 1.4 billion or 3.4% versus the prior year. Margins were 43.7% down from 45.5% in the prior year as a result of the approximately 28% equipment revenue growth in the year. Now let's turn to Slide 9 to discuss our Consumer operating metrics. Our flexible mix and match plans are at the heart of our go-to-market strategy, supporting continued strong demand for higher tier premium mobility and broadband offerings. Postpaid phone net adds were $336,000 in the quarter. We competed effectively during the holiday season, even as the switcher pool remains soft compared to pre-pandemic levels due to elevated retention promotions in the marketplace. Fourth quarter phone gross adds were up approximately 11% compared to the same period last year, but were approximately 15% lower than the 2019 level. We continue to achieve customer retention with postpaid phone churn of 0.77% for the fourth quarter, relatively flat compared to the same period last year and well below pre-pandemic levels even as trading volumes pick. We maintained the momentum of attracting high-quality customers with approximately 60% of new accounts taking a premium unlimited plan and over one-third of our base accounts now on a premium unlimited tier. 5G penetration continued to expand with approximately 34% of our phone base now equipped with a 5G capable device at year-end. We expect to drive further 5G Ultra Wideband adoption with the launch last week of our C-band spectrum to more than 90 million POPs, combined with our updated mix and match offerings introduced earlier this month. With the close of the acquisition, TracPhone results are now included in consumer prepaid. We finished the year as the nation's leading value segment provider with approximately 24 million total prepaid customers including the approximately 20 million customers acquired from TracFone. For the quarter, prepaid net customer losses totaled $85,000, which included 52,000 net losses on the TracFone businesses stemming from stronger demand for postpaid plans due to promos in that segment, coupled with handset supply constraint. Now let's move to Slide 10 to review the business group results. Operating revenue for the business segment was $7.8 billion in the fourth quarter, down 3.0% year-over-year. We faced elevated pressures in the quarter in both public sector and wholesale, and we expect these pressures to moderate in 2022. Full year operating revenue was $31.0 billion, up slightly year-over-year driven by strong wireless performance. Wireless service revenue increased 1.5% and wireless equipment revenue was up 9.6% in the fourth", "doc_id": "206d142c-286c-4cf1-9702-76e99bc661ca", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "e83b266e91fb59a794fa1a91a114c687753f0eea35deab97b3e9f9a526f4f0ef", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 84320, "end": 88385, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "6c27518e-16d3-4894-b1b0-4c2024e90f77", "3": "0d04bbd5-277e-495e-8877-6d66934763e6"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "0d04bbd5-277e-495e-8877-6d66934763e6": {"__data__": {"text": "1.5% and wireless equipment revenue was up 9.6% in the fourth quarter. Wireless service revenue was driven by growth in small and medium business and enterprise performance improved for the fourth consecutive quarter and was the highest growth since the start of the pandemic. While this was partially offset by a decline in public sector due to the elevated distance learning activity in the year ago period, our Verizon frontline campaign is resonating with stakeholders, helping drive new customer growth. Wireline trends remain under pressure as we continue to face prior year comps that included pandemic buying. In addition, approximately one-third of our declines came from voice services where we continue to feel the impact of our strategic initiative to exit the low-margin international wholesale voice market. Business segment EBITDA was $1.8 billion, down 7.4% from the same quarter last year. Business segment EBITDA margin was 23.5% in the quarter, reflecting pressure in legacy wireline products and our commitment to invest in new product growth and drive customer demand for our wireless solutions. Full year margins were 24.2%, down 120 basis points from last year. We exited the year with strong momentum in business activity and demand for our wireless products. With the recent launch of our C-band spectrum, we are in an even better position to serve the 5G needs of our business customers throughout 2022. For the quarter, phone gross adds were up approximately 22% year-over-year and 8% from 4Q 2019 levels. The fourth quarter represented the strongest quarterly phone gross add performance for small and medium business and enterprise since launching Verizon 2.0. Segment postpaid phone churn was 1.01% in the quarter, which was up slightly over the prior year. As a result, total postpaid phone net adds were $222,000, our best quarterly performance since the onset of the pandemic. Now let's move to our consolidated cash flow summary. Cash generation remains strong for 2021 as we achieved our financial targets and executed on our capital allocation plan. We spent over $45 billion of C-band spectrum and expanded our portfolio with the TracFone acquisition, all while increasing our dividend for the 15th straight year and making progress to maintain a healthy balance sheet. The business continues to generate strong cash flow. Cash flow from operating activities totaled $39.5 billion for the year, a decline of $2.2 billion. This result primarily reflects strong performance in the business with increased adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion, offset by higher working capital from device payment receivables and slightly higher cash taxes. Capital spending in 2021 totaled $20.3 billion as we continue to support traffic growth on our 4G LTE network while initiating the first phase of C-band deployment covering 90 million POPs. C-band-related CapEx was approximately $2.1 billion in 2021. As a result, free cash flow for the full year was $19.3 billion, down from $23.6 billion in 2020. The highlights of our financing activity in 2021 was efficiently funding our C-band spectrum investment in the first quarter. Since then, we are focused on further optimizing our cash position and debt maturity profile with activity to reduce or extend near-term maturities, while deploying excess cash to retire longer-dated high-coupon bonds. We accomplished this while maintaining ample flexibility to invest in our business such as fund in the recent TracFone acquisition. We are also active with our ABS funding program to finance the increased device payment receivables as consumers upgrade to 5G phones. We exited the year with $133.7 billion of net unsecured debt, a $3.7 billion reduction from the end of the first quarter. Our unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 2.8 times at year-end, in line with our 2021 Investor Day guidance. Our financing activities over the past two years have reduced our average portfolio borrowing costs by about 1% as compared to 2019, albeit with higher debt levels. Our cash balance at the end of the year was $2.9 billion, down approximately $7.0 billion sequentially, bringing us back to normal levels.

Let's move on to Slide 13 to discuss our outlook for 2022. We have great momentum from the strong operating and financial results last year and are well positioned heading into the new year, and that momentum is reflected in our guidance for 2022. We took many strategic actions to position the Company for better growth and our increased guidance disclosures provide greater insight into our financial outlook. At our Investor Day last year, we provided guidance of at least 3% service and other revenue for 2022 and 2023. For 2022, we expect organic service and other revenue growth of around 3%. On a reported basis, which includes the net impact of the sale of Verizon Media Group and our ownership of TracFone, service and other revenue growth is expected to range between 1.0% and 1.5%. Similarly, on a reported basis, wireless service revenue growth for 2022 is expected to be in the range of 9% to 10%, driven by growth from our tiered unlimited strategy, the impact of the TracFone acquisition, and a ramping fixed wireless access contribution. Excluding the impact of the TracFone acquisition, wireless service revenue is expected to grow at least 3%. We expect total adjusted EBITDA to grow 2% to 3% in 2022, driven by top line growth and ongoing cost discipline. Full year adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $5.40 to $5.55. As the waterfall chart shows, we expect adjusted EBITDA growth, including a small positive net contribution from the TracFone and Media transactions to be offset by headwinds from below-the-line items. These items include approximately $0.15 from our C-band investment, including higher depreciation and lower capitalized interest as we put the spectrum into service, $0.07 share dilution as a result of shares issued in the TracFone acquisition, and other noncash impacts such as D&A and pension and OPEB expense. Our adjusted effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 23% to 25% based on current legislation. Capital spending for the full year, excluding C-band, is expected to be between $16.5 billion and $17.5 billion, a decrease from the $18.2 billion in 2021, and as we have started our progress towards lower capital intensity. C-band capital spend is anticipated to be between $5 billion to $6 billion as we continue to build out the initial markets and begin preparations to deploying Phase II spectrum. For 2022, cash flow from operations are expected to be driven by higher operating income, offset by increased working capital from device payment receivables as well as higher cash taxes. We are extremely excited for 2022 and expect it to be our biggest year yet. The second wave of 5G is here, and we are leading the way into the future of connectivity. We have the necessary assets and strategy to unlock the full potential of our growth vectors. With that, I will hand it over to Hans to discuss our 2022 strategic priorities. Thank you, Matt. The assets are in place to make 2022 Verizon's best year yet. Coming off a catalyst year, we are excited to execute on our 5G growth and deliver the financial targets we laid out at our Investor Day back in March of last year. We have clear priorities for the year. We will continue our legacy of disciplined execution and look forward to delivering against our operation and financial targets that Matt just outlined. We expect organic service and other revenue growth of around 3% in 2022. And we also expect to increase EBITDA by 2% to 3%. We commit to strengthen and growing our core business and commercializing our unique assets. By combining our Verizon Ultra Wideband with the new mix and match plans, we can supercharge 5G Ultra Wideband adoption to enhance customer experiences and to increase average revenue per user. At the same time, we will continue to expand our fixed wireless access positioning Verizon as a premier nationwide broadband provider. We believe that Verizon's fixed wire access offering will drive the next leg of broadband growth, increasing our market share and reach. We will innovate in our business of business offerings, bringing mobile edge computing to our enterprise clients and transform the Internet of Things from a vision to", "doc_id": "0b9eb27f-e23a-4cb0-98d6-93b920dee956", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "9722d4f0175ecf0de8ff0dd00880dc96351c335bd803315c4de1a6476010ef32", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 92606, "end": 96835, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "0d04bbd5-277e-495e-8877-6d66934763e6", "3": "7079bfb3-0b4b-46b7-b3e3-6a0761cc6ede"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "7079bfb3-0b4b-46b7-b3e3-6a0761cc6ede": {"__data__": {"text": "mobile edge computing to our enterprise clients and transform the Internet of Things from a vision to reality.

The integration of TracFone will form the basis of deep and productive relationships that can grow to meet our customers' changing needs throughout life. We will continue to run Verizon as a purpose-driven organization. We will pursue C-band and 5G leadership because these technologies are critical for economic prosperity and driving innovation for all, not just for Verizon. We will continue to serve all of our stakeholders, shareholders, customers, employees and society. And lastly, I also hope to see you all again at our upcoming Investor Day on March 3. With that, I hand it back to Brady. Thank you, Hans. Brad, we're now ready to take questions. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  Your first question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, sir. With regards to the guidance you've given for about 3% growth in service and other revenue, very similar to your growth target for just straight up wireless service revenue. Could you give us a little more insight as to what you anticipate to be the principal drivers? In other words, to what extent is this continuing to see people upgrade into higher tier plans, meaning, it's very much an RPA-driven story. And are we getting to a point where you're expecting a more material contribution in some of those emerging growth opportunities, whether it's fixed wireless or mobile edge compute? And then just one more sort of follow-up there on broadband, now that we're starting to see the fixed wireless net adds begin to ramp, should we expect that they're going to be the predominant driver of your aggregate broadband net adds going forward? And could you give us some insight as to where those customers are coming from? In other words, are they primarily Verizon mobile customers taking a bundle? Or are you actually reaching a new demographic? Thank you. Thank you, Brett. Let me start and get additional matter. When it comes to the growth in 2022, first of all, I think, we're coming in with a great momentum from 2021, both in our business and in our consumer units. Both of them have done a great job at the end of last year. Topping that, of course, with the C-band launch, which we're very excited about, and we see a very, very good performance with our new offerings, both on the business side and the consumer side with mix and match and all of that. That all great, of course, for us, what we feel is a great momentum coming into this year, and we also have the step-ups and as you heard me and Matt talking even though we are continuing to step up our customers, we even have more to do there. And we have a coupl, ['Matt Ellis', 'Hans Vestberg', 'Brady Connor', 'Operator', 'Brett Feldman']\n3, AVGO, 4, 2021, 2021-12-09 21:45:29, Hello and welcome to Broadcom\u2019s Inc.

In addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Broadcom reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today's press release. Comments made during today's call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results. I will now turn the call over to Hock. Thank you, Ji, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. So in the environment we have today enterprise demand rebounded sharply over 30% year-on-year. HyperCloud and Service Provider demand continued to be strong and strong wireless growth in Q4 was driven by the seasonal launch of next generation smartphones by our North American OEM. Meanwhile, our core software business continues to be steady with a focus on strategic customers. On the supply side, only times remain extended and stable, inventory in our channels and our customers remains very lean. Accordingly in Q4 semiconductor solutions revenue grew 17% year-on-year to 5.6 billion and with infrastructure software revenue growing 8% year-on-year to $1.8 billion. Consolidated net revenue was a record $7.4 billion up 15% year-on-year. Let me now provide more color by end markets. Let's start with networking. Networking revenue of 1.9 billion was up 13% year-on-year in line with our forecasts for low double-digit growth and represented 34% of our semiconductor revenue. Double-digit year-on-year growth was primarily driven by strong demand from campus switching both from our merchant silicon as well as ASICs solutions through OEMs, like Cisco and HP. We also experienced similar double-digit growth with the deployment of Jericho routers within large scale AI networks in the cloud, as well as Qumran in 5G infrastructure and DCI. Our unique capability here to deliver ultra-low latency ethernet networks enables large scale deployment of AI compute for the cloud. Meanwhile, in the core of these large data centers, we have begun to run Trident 4 and Tomahawk 4, the world's first 25.6 terabit per second switch to several hyperscale cloud customers as they address their ever-growing need for bandwidth demand in scaling out their massive data centers. Now within hyperscale cloud, we continue to lead in delivering A6 silicon for multiple compute offload accelerators, which has manifested into being 20% of our networking revenue. Expect continued growth in the next fiscal years here to over $2 billion. The key to our success here lies with our robust design methodology, which integrates a broad and substantial silicon IP and rapidly delivers world-class customized silicon SOCs to enable AI virtualization, orchestration, video transcoding and security. We have now extended our footprint here, beyond TPUs at multiple cloud customers. In Q1, networking is firing on all cylinders. And we expect networking revenue growth to accelerate to close to 30% year-on-year. Next, our server storage connectivity revenue was $815 million, up 21% year-on-year, in sharp contrast to the first half of 2021 and represented 15% of semiconductor revenue. The better than expected results were driven by robust demand for storage controllers, and host bus adapters from renewed spend by enterprises, upgrading their compute and storage infrastructure. Additionally, hypercloud storage we saw accelerated migration to eight terabytes, and the start of 20 terabyte hard disk drives, which drove our nearline storage revenue.

Spending for enterprise continues to recover and we expect this will accelerate growth in our server storage connectivity revenue in Q1 to approximately 30% year-on-year growth. Moving on to Broadband. Revenue of 872 million grew 29% year-on-year and represented 16% of semiconductor revenue. This was driven by the continued strong growth in deployment by service providers globally of next generation PON with Wi-Fi 6 and 6C access gateways. We continue to lead the industry with a portfolio of end-to-end integrated solutions across access protocols. PON, cable modem and DSL, all SOC controllers, each with integrated Wi-Fi managed through our software stacks to reliably deliver more bandwidth, faster data speeds from the call service provider networks to the homes. And the critical element in our broadband platform is leading edge Wi-Fi; Wi-Fi 6 and 6c today and Wi-Fi 7 tomorrow. Having leading edge while wireless is important for service provider customers to reach digital homes from their networks. By the same token in campus switching in enterprises, it's also critical that our OEMs can connect enterprise data centers through campus switches to the access points with leading edge Wi-Fi. In both markets are our platforms, which encompass wired and wireless, silicon and software uniquely differentiate Broadcom and sustain our market leadership. So in Q1, we expect this double-digit percent year-on-year growth rate in broadband to continue, as we have seen for the last few years. Moving on to wireless, consistent with the launch of our customers next generation phone during the quarter, Q4 revenue of $1.8 billion represented 32% of semiconductor revenue and was up 21% against a softer Q4 quarter a year ago. Nevertheless, we expect continuing strong demand into Q1 and which will drive wireless revenue to be up sequentially single-digit, and be flat to up low single digit percentage year-on-year from the peak of a year ago. Finally, industrial revenue up 197 million represented approximately 3% of our Q4 semiconductor solutions revenue. Having said this, resales of industrial up $232 million grew 36% year-over-year in Q4, driven by strong demand from OEMs for electric vehicles, robotics, factory automation and healthcare. As a result, our inventory in the channel declined further to below a month. And turning to Q1, we expect resales to continue to be strong at the levels we saw in Q4. In summary, Q4 semiconductor solutions revenue was up 17% year-on-year. And in Q1, we expect the momentum to continue and revenue growth to be up double digits again year-on-year. This implies that Q1 semiconductor revenue will be up low single digits sequentially. Turning to software Q4, infrastructure software revenue of 1.8 billion grew 8% year-on-year represented 24% of total revenue within this brocade showed strong growth of 19% year-on-year, consistent with strong enterprise recovery during the quarter, and deployment of our next Generation 7 fiber channel stem products. Now excluding brocade our core software revenue grew 6% year-on-year in dollar terms, consolidated renewal rates averaged 116% over expiring contracts. While within our strategic accounts, we actually averaged 127% consistent with prior quarters. Over 90% of the value represented recurring subscription and maintenance. Stepping back and following the Software Investor Day last month, let me provide an update on the entire fiscal '21 for core software. Total backlog at the end of the year, totaled $14.9 billion up 15% from a year ago, with average duration of contracts extending from 2.6 to 2.9 years. These backlog translates into an ARR or annual recurring revenue of 5.2 billion, which was up 5% from a year ago. 74% of this ARR comes from our approximately 600 strategic accounts, which in fiscal '21 we renewed at 129% or $2.4 billion of annualized booking value. 1.9 billion of this represented renewal on expiring contracts and roughly $500 million represented cross-selling including PLAs of", "doc_id": "201190e6-8a6d-462b-9d24-7dd5fe249c53", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "6e29ddcd8cf5b3cc6205d1c2604a3894d420823c3755ec877f2e41b531e870a9", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 105187, "end": 109283, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "5fe87431-aba0-41ec-afb9-a4f375d74041", "3": "03be0bd6-48d9-447b-b0a7-aae088fe121b"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "03be0bd6-48d9-447b-b0a7-aae088fe121b": {"__data__": {"text": "on expiring contracts and roughly $500 million represented cross-selling including PLAs of our portfolio products to these strategic customers. For the year, we booked over 300 contracts generating greater than a million dollars of revenue annually with over 30 contracts generating over $10 million annually. With such stability in Q1, we expect our infrastructure software revenue to continue to sustain around mid-single digit percentage growth year-over-year. So, let me summarize, with the continued strength in our semiconductor segment and steady growth in our software segment, total Q4 net revenue grew 15% year-on-year. Turning to Q1, semiconductor revenue excluding wireless is expected to be up 28% year-on-year. Wireless is expected to grow flat to low single digit percentage compared to the peak of a year ago. So semiconductor revenue in total is expected to grow 17% year-on-year again, and consolidated revenue is expected to grow 14% year-on-year. Sequentially, this will drive revenue to grow from $7.4 billion in Q4 to $7.6 billion in Q1. We are very well positioned in every one of our franchise markets in fiscal '22 and beyond. We continue to significantly out invest anyone else across our platforms in switching and routing, offload compute, silicon photonics and wireless connectivity to accelerate our next generation roadmaps as we continue to gain market share. With that, let me turn the call over to Kirsten. Thank you Hock. Let me now provide additional detail on our financial performance. Revenue was 7.4 billion for the quarter up 15% from a year ago. Gross margins were 75% of revenue in the quarter and up approximately 105 basis points year-on-year. Operating expenses were 1.1 billion up 3% year-on-year driven by investment in R&D. Operating income for the quarter was 4.4 billion and was up 20% from a year ago. Operating margin was 59% of revenue up approximately 286 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA was 4.5 billion or 61% of revenue. This figure excludes 134 million of depreciation. Now overview of the P&L for our two segments. Revenue for our semiconductor solutions segment was 5.6 billion and represented 76% of total revenue in the quarter. This was up 17% year-on-year. Gross margins for our semiconductor solutions segment were approximately 70% up 170 basis points year-on-year driven by favorable product mix and content growth in next generation products across our extensive product portfolio. Note that we have been able to continue to expand our semiconductor gross margin despite higher wireless revenue mix. Operating expenses were 790 million in Q4 up 3% year-on-year. R&D was 701 million in the quarter up 6% year-on-year. As a side note for fiscal '22, we are planning to increase R&D spend in semiconductors by mid-to-high single digit percent year-on-year. As Hock indicated in his remarks, we are committed to investing heavily in our next generation products to maintain and even increase our leadership across all our franchises. Q4 operating margins increased to 56% up 350 basis points year-on-year. So while semiconductor revenue was up 17%, operating profit grew 24%. Moving to the P&L for our infrastructure software segment, revenue for infrastructure software was 1.8 billion and represented 24% of revenue. This was at 8% year-on-year. Gross margins for infrastructure software were 90% in the quarter up 19 basis points year-over-year. Operating expenses were 353 million in the quarter up 1% year-over-year, R&D spending at 220 million is up 9% year-over-year and SG&A of 133 million is down 10% year-over-year. Operating margin was 70% in Q4 up 166 basis points year-over-year and operating profit grew 11%. Moving to cash flow, free cash flow in the quarter was 3.5 billion representing 47% of revenue. We spent 88 million on capital expenditures. Day sales outstanding were 25 days in the fourth quarter, compared to 32 days a year ago.

We ended the fourth quarter with inventory of 1.3 billion, an increase of 137 million or 12% from the end of the prior quarter in preparation to meet customer demand in Q1. We ended the fourth quarter with 12.2 billion of cash and 39.7 billion of total debt, of which 290 million is short-term. Turning to capital allocation. In the quarter, we paid stockholders 1.2 billion of cash dividends. We also paid 266 million in withholding taxes due on vesting of employee equity, resulting in the elimination of 525,000 AVGO shares. We ended the quarter with 413 million outstanding common shares and 448 million diluted shares. Based on current business trends and conditions, our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 is for consolidated revenues up 7.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA of approximately 61.5% of projected revenue. Let me recap our financial performance for fiscal year 2021. Our revenue hit a new record of 27.5 billion growing 15% year-on-year, semiconductor solutions revenue was 20.4 billion up 18% year-over-year. Infrastructure software revenue was 7.1 billion up 7% year-on-year. Gross margin for the year was 75% up 100 basis points from a year ago. Operating expenses were 4.5 billion down 2% year-on-year as we completed the integration of Symantec. Operating income from continuing operations was 15.9 billion up 23% year-over-year and represented 58% of net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was 16.6 billion, up 21% year-over-year, and represented 60% of net revenue. This figure excludes 539 million of depreciation. We spent 443 million on capital expenditures, and free cash flow represented 49% of revenue, or 13.3 billion, free cash flow grew 15% year-over-year. For the year, we returned 7.5 billion to our stockholders, consisting of 6.2 billion in the form of cash dividends and 1.3 billion for the elimination of 2.8 million AVGO shares. We have extended our weighted average debt maturity to approximately 10.6 years, with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.6%. Looking ahead to fiscal 2022, we remain committed to returning approximately 50% of our prior year free cash flow to stockholders in the form of cash dividends. Consistent with that, we are increasing our quarterly common stock cash dividend in Q1 fiscal '22 to $4.10 per share, an increase of 14% from the prior quarter. We intend to maintain this target quarterly dividend throughout this year, subject to quarterly board approval. Today, as part of our commitment to return capital to shareholders, we announced that the company's Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase about 10 billion of our common stock under Broadcom's new share repurchase program. The authorization is effective until December 31, 2022. This new share repurchase program reflects our confidence in the company's ability to generate strong and sustainable cash flow. Note that we expect the diluted share count to be 448 million in Q1. This excludes the potential impact of any share repurchase. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions. Thank you.  Our first question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. The line is open. Hi, thank you so much for taking the question. And congrats on the very solid results. Hock, I know you guys don't guide for the full year, but I was hoping you could kind of walk us through how you're thinking about fiscal year '22 on the semiconductor side. Obviously, bookings have been strong, continued to be strong across most of your buckets, or end markets within semis. But if you can talk about, bookings trends in the quarter, what you're seeing there, that would be super helpful. And then as you sort of answer the fiscal '22 question, if you can touch on supply, and to what extent supply could be a gating factor over the next 12 months? That'll be helpful. Thank you. That's a very good, a hell of a question. So let me try to address in its various component parts.

What we continue to see, we've the recovery -- I made a point of saying that, we're now in a midst of a very strong spending recovery in enterprise, particularly, so we're continuing to see strong demand bookings in the semiconductors side. But a big part of that and demand and increasing part of that demand is now coming from enterprise spending, which translates to end markets, tends to drive a lot of our broadband continue to drive the broadband, which has been strong in most of '21 continuing to drive the enterprise part of our networking business. And, of course, server storage and industrial is just very, very strong. Having said that, on the hypercloud spending side, a lot of it resides in, obviously, in our networking business. Things are still fairly, very elevated, Demand continues to be strong. And so when you combine all this together, we continue to see booking rates been at a fairly and continue to be at a very elevated level week-after-week so far. And as of right now, we're pretty much booked all the way through '22 and even beyond '22 into '23. If you're thinking about 50 week lead time, no surprise, it goes too late '22. But we're going even -- in many cases now gone beyond '22 into '23. And that's partly because one timing of our customers planning very far ahead. And two, as I said, our continuing discipline approach to ensuring that we deliver products at the right time to the right place. And we see that going on. And I hate to disappoint you, we're still not ready or prepared to give you guidance on a whole fiscal year. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is open. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Hock, I wanted to follow up on those lead times. You said obviously, on the industrial space, your channels lean it sounds like your bookings overall is very strong. At the same time, we know you've been taking efforts to limit like worries around stockpiling and over shipping, whether it's parsing orders, expedite these. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about what you are doing in that space. How are you feeling right now in terms of your shipments versus where end demand is? And how meaningful those like long with 50 plus week lead time actually are? Do they actually represent demand even if it's that far out? Like if you could just talk about your efforts there? That'd be that'd be helpful. Yes. Well, we've been doing this 50 weeks now for just since the beginning of '21. And we've been delivering very much as much as we can to those lead times. So in some ways, I like to believe it's giving some method or some method to this booking madness, I guess is one, I would call it in terms of our ability and in terms of where we -- how we are shipping the products. And but by keeping lead times very stable and predictable as we're doing now. We're also clearly communicating to our end users, the way they should be planning their business and I like to think all this is working out in terms of allowing us to making sure we don't overshoot and build up x buffer inventory to our ecosystem out there that means distributors, channels and customers. And all that is been done purposefully and the truth be told that the day will come when things have to land, unknown, and we'd like to make sure it lands very gently and softly. I would like to think that it's working very well. And, but so what we are reporting in some sectors now, what we're guiding in some sectors are reporting, where you see growth of some 20%, 30%. I know even from our perspective, it seems very hot, excessively hot. And in those areas, in particular, we take strong particular attempts -- to make those attempts to ensure this product, we shape our four programs they get deployed, rather than sit on a shelf for a future need. And so I like to believe that growth in networking, broadband service storage lately, of some 20% to 30%, year-on-year, rail through end demand. Got it. That's helpful.

Especially for networking and storage or just I'm not sure if my year ago numbers are trending or not? But do you expect those businesses to decline sequentially within the comp guidance within the guidance? It may, depending then we're talking mathematical numbers now and how we shipped because some the shipments are lumpy. And you may see them from quarter-to-quarter, when you talk about sequential quarter, you may sometimes see them and what I'm trying to say. And we may also chose to deploy supplying to one market versus another as you go quarter-by-quarter. So looking at it sequentially in specific verticals might sometimes for our case, our point of view be rather misleading, unintentionally, I may add, simply because we may chose to deploy our ship more to sponsors sometimes to server storage, because there is a hotter need there versus to networking. And you may see them because of that networking, see some sequential weakness in one particular quarter, which is why we report as much as we can on a year-on-year basis, where then you take out the effects of this short term, lumpiness, and short-term discontinuities. That's helpful. Thank you so much. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Good afternoon. And congratulations on the strong results and execution. Hock, in your networking business, you've been somewhat conservative on your view on the sustainability of the strong cloud and hyperscale growth, but yet, in cloud, I mean, you guys are ramping 7-nanometer Tomahawk 4 and Trident 4. They're in the early innings as they ramp. Demand is strong. You talked about Jericho and Qumran being strong in routing. Your cloud ASIC customers ramping their 7-nanometer TPU. And you have more programs firing next year, as you mentioned. And then on the enterprise side, your large enterprise OEM customers are benefiting from the strong recovery. So you're starting off the fiscal year in networking with strong double-digit growth. But do you see your networking business continuing to drive double-digits year-over-year growth for the full year? And will the growth be driven by all three of your end markets cloud, enterprise, and service provider? Harlan that's hell of a question. And the only way I can answer that is, this is a weird time for me to bad to ask me to guide you on networking for the year in working, I'm not doing that. But you're right though. There are a lot of levels. And I articulate quite a few of them and maybe I'm oversee in some cases. And they seem to be as I use the expression as we sit here today and going into '22, firing on all cylinders. And by that, I mean more than just forecasting. We actually seen the backlog, we have the backlog and they keep building up. And you're right hypercloud guys, if you have asked me six months ago, I would not believe the level of spending they're embarking on in right now in '22 but they appear to be. So you are right, enterprise been strong. And you've seen the rate of growth of enterprise year-on-year of 30% across broadly. And cloud at their current elevated levels, we are seeing in networking has not suffered, has not weakened. We are still sustaining. Now, it's not recovering, obviously, year-on-year basis as fast as enterprise is showing simply because enterprise starting from a lower point. But Cloud is still growing, we are seeing hypercloud growing. And it's growing from not just network switching and routing that's our traditional strength is growing now for us on, for one of a better expression collectively called offload computing applications from virtualization orchestration to add more and more AI beyond just a single lead customer we have in TPUs today. So we're seeing multiple, as I said, multiple levels all moving in the right direction for fiscal '22.

Great, thank you for the insight, Hock. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Your line is open. Thank you for taking my question. And congratulations on the strong results and the guidance. So Hock, I find two things interesting. One is you didn't use the word metaphors in your commentary. But that's not my question. The question is on the buyback announcement. What changed your view? Because for some time, you were not as favorable towards buybacks. So the 10 billion announcement, is that more a statement about business trend? Is it lack of M&A targets, are you going to be more consistent in buybacks? So that's part A of the question. And part B is that if I take that, 6 billion or 7 billion in dividends that you will pay next year and add the 10 billion in buybacks and apply the free cash flow range you have. It suggests sales of somewhere in the low to mid 30 billion, right, using that math? And I know you're not giving a guidance, but does that math makes sense. Thank you. Hey, you're very good at these numbers. I shall just bow to those better judgment and wisdom. Yes. Thank you. Next question. You have another follow through? Please. Yes. Thank you. Yes. So wireless, is your most seasonal business. Is there a way you're thinking about wireless? So you said it could be up somewhat right in the January quarter? How are you thinking about seasonality for that business going into the April quarter? Oh, April quarter quota is hard to forecast. I mean, this is consumer. So it's very -- I can't even begin to forecast much less than I think my customer would be better at it. And even then, I suspect they're very challenged. But what we do see, interestingly enough, is demand for our components for the January quarter is good. And then and hence you see, the fact that even as we measure year-on-year to an all-time peak a year ago, we are still flattish to slightly up and sequentially from Q4, which in this current round, you're correct in this regard. Q4 is supposed to be back to normality and seasonality has been the big quarter. Our Q1 will exceed our Q4 shipments as we forecast today. So yes, it sounds like even that part is doing quite well, just that year-on-year compare in percentage terms may not be as exciting as the rest of the semiconductor verticals that we're in, but it's still holding up very nicely. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Hi, thanks for letting me ask the question. I guess I'll ask the two questions and then I'll listen to the answers for both the question and the follow-up. So, first, Hock, I want to revisit kind of the quality of demand and may be ask it a different way. You've talked about under-shipping what the actual demand or what your bookings are because you believe you can ship to actual demand. So that delta between what you're shipping and what is being booked, is that changing, is it shrinking, growing, basically trying to get at any change in customer behavior? And then the second question would be a separated one for Kirsten, you mentioned about the OpEx in the semiconductor side rising going forward, any more color about the linearity of OpEx as we go throughout the year and any color on kind of the areas that would be focuses of that investment? On the first, Ross, that's a very, very clever question I might add. Has anything changed between what we're booking versus what we're shipping, I'm trying to answer it not  because -- I'm not trying to answer it is because the demand by verticals has rotated somewhat and you can probably understand it. So what I'm saying is, one clear example is what I'm saying now, enterprise is actually waking up big time and they are asking for products, they asking for products in a very, very urgent manner.

And by verticals, we're seeing strength in basically in server storage in particular and also the enterprise portion all for networking, hence the strength in, as I mentioned campus switching and Wi-Fi in many ways, because enterprise, you know campus switching now for enterprise switching needs a wireless strategy component. And so we're seeing our Wi-Fi business for access gateways in enterprise really take off now. Having said that, our classification of cloud includes telcos, service providers, they have been steady. It's interesting cloud and telcos have been steady. And -- but they have been steady in different manner. The cloud guys are now pushing more and more into compute offload, I mean the programs we're working on starting to happen -- starting to manifest as deployment, so we're seeing that, and that is really driving some more growth than just normal switching and routing that we have seen super strong in 2021. We have seen areas like in some of their very massive scale out of machine learning or AI networks, here you need a different kind of performance of those networks. So we've seen a different kind of products going into that areas. And I highlighted in my remarks about Jericho being going into many of those AI networks in hypercloud and, of course, 5G continues to be -- goes through cycles and happen to be a  5G deployment and backhaul is strong and we ship a lot of Qumrans. So it varies. But if you take it from a macro point of view, not -- hasn't changed from six months ago, Ross, which is the under-shipment from the level of bookings we're seeing. For the OpEx, Kirsten? Hi, Ross. Sure. Hi, Ross. So what I would expect, the way I'd look at OpEx, I'll comment on our consolidated view for the company. You're going to see a step-up in Q1 definitely. And then, remember in Q2, we have the payroll taxes that we pay in Q2. So we have another step-up in Q2 and then for the rest of the year, I'd look at that continuing out, how I would model that. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question and congratulations on the strong results. Hock, maybe just a follow-on to Ross's question about the R&D commentary that Kirsten had in the prepared comments. With the growth that you're expecting in the semi R&D, do you think that, that will outstrip the semiconductor revenue growth for the year or not? And not having had the time yet to go back and look, is this an unusual spend year, and if so, what's driving it? Is it concern about increased competition, is it the opportunity set getting a lot bigger and kind of what areas are you focused on? And then I have a follow-up. I think we have continued to be -- to have been spending on R&D in the silicon side on a fairly consistent basis, and so we have. And, but in some other areas and it's not so much about worry about competition as -- see the underlying part of our business model across our various franchises is simply that we always out-invest, out-engineer anybody else in the verticals we -- in those franchise verticals we are in. And so what -- from our point of view,, ['John Pitzer', 'Stacy Rasgon', 'Harlan Sur', 'Ross Seymore', 'Ji Yoo', 'Hock Tan', 'Operator', 'Vivek Arya', 'Kirsten Spears', 'Toshiya Hari']\n4, BA, 4, 2021, 2022-01-26 13:46:02, Thank you for standing by.

Mr. Welch, please go ahead. Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Boeing\u2019s fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. I am Matt Welch and with me today are Dave Calhoun, Boeing\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, and Brian West, Boeing\u2019s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. And as a reminder, you can follow today\u2019s broadcast and slide presentation through our website at boeing.com. As always, we have provided detailed financial information in our press release issued earlier today. Projections, estimates and goals we include in our discussions this morning involve risks, including those described in our SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the end of the web presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of certain non-GAAP measures. Now, I will turn the call over to Dave Calhoun. Yes. Thanks, Matt. Just upfront, we\u2019ve changed in this format just a bit so that I can limit my remarks upfront to some observations and thoughts with respect to where we are in this rebuilding process. And then, Brian will take you into more detail on the financial side. With respect to the environment, there\u2019s no doubt Omicron has paused the industry recovery. But it has not changed the outlook for the industry recovery, such that while it might be delayed a few more months, the bookings and the customer discussions with respect to fleet plans, medium and long term, are still quite robust. And we are quite confident in that outlook. 2021 I would characterize for Boeing as a rebuilding year. We came from recovery to rebuilding. And I give our team a lot of credit for, frankly, making a lot of progress on that front. Number one, on the orders front and demand, particularly led by the MAX and the freighter market, I feel very good about where things are and the competitiveness of our product line with respect to that market. Supply constraints to date have not constrained us. On the other hand, I think in the medium to long-term future, it\u2019s something we all have to plan for. I\u2019ve always viewed the unfortunate means by which we got here and the buildup of finished goods inventory, both with respect to the MAX and the 787, as sort of a double-edged sword. I hate that we have a lot of inventory. On the other hand, it will probably serve us well in what is likely to be a robust recovery. With respect to fleet rebuilding, I would also just like to highlight the efficiency gains and maybe even more importantly, the emissions gains that our customers enjoy when they replace their current fleet with these new aircraft are significant, and the pressures are severe. So, I think that creates some additive pressure with respect to fleet renewals as we move forward. And I don\u2019t think either of those will let up. The MAX return to service. I\u2019m quite proud of where we are on that. We have regulatory approval now in almost every jurisdiction in the world. You know that China, Indonesia and Ethiopia all delivered prior to the end of the year. We delivered 245 airplanes in \u201821. We\u2019ve flown safely over 800,000 flight hours, 99.3% service reliability. And we\u2019ve now flown more post the MAX grounding than we did pre-MAX grounding. China is preparing for their MAX return to service and for delivery. And we have set up a plan that allows for that in the first quarter. But of course, they\u2019ll take them as the government returns the current fleet to service. Our customers are moving methodically and very well with respect to that return to service. 87, very unfortunate charge that we took here in the fourth quarter. It reflects everything we\u2019ve learned about the rework process itself, the data required to restart deliveries and obtain ticketing and then customer expectations regarding concessions as we move forward. With all that said, I still feel fantastic about the future of the 787 airplane for The Boeing Company. And anyway, as I think I point out every time we get together, these 87s today, the field", "doc_id": "d85514ea-5f6e-44b0-84b2-056c82594f17", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "6dc18e5f24dc407eb8a1a5804d369db1c40f15760754f84818253f30d11b01ea", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 133587, "end": 137719, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "885ad1a4-f75e-40c4-90a9-d66a732dbe1b", "3": "2e8f9f6e-d215-4b2b-80f1-0dafcac4b19f"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "2e8f9f6e-d215-4b2b-80f1-0dafcac4b19f": {"__data__": {"text": "as I think I point out every time we get together, these 87s today, the field -- the fleet and service is flying, is more utilized than any other widebody airplane. 99% of it is in service today with respect to the pre-pandemic levels. And it\u2019s the most utilized widebody out there, 98.99% reliability. So, this is a great product line and a competitive product. And as soon as we begin delivery, we feel very good about the ultimate recovery. On BDS, we did hit a bunch of really important milestones. The MQ-25, we experienced our first refueling, and we began carrier tests. The T-7A production line, which is based on significantly improved development process and engineering modeling capabilities, is off to a very good start, and the efficiency associated with that development process is being realized. And then, the tanker. The tanker today, despite the charge, again, which we don\u2019t feel great about by any respect, but the tanker today is an incredible asset for our customer and now serves 70% of the missions that were intended in the development of the tanker. And our job is to continue to deliver the tanker and to do it more expeditiously as we move forward. The good news is our customer likes the performance of the airplane. And again, we intend to serve that need. Global Services, it is recovering like all the service businesses that surround aviation. It\u2019s on a great path. The team is doing a terrific job. We had a small write-off with respect to materials that ultimately would not be utilized in this recovery. But BGS is doing quite well, and is experiencing the recovery. And then, I feel very good about the free cash flow that we generated in the fourth quarter. As everybody knows, we have been focused relentlessly on improving our free cash flow situation. It has been our number one metric. And to be able to achieve that I think is terrific news. Sustainability, it is the one issue every customer wants to talk to us about, not with respect to 2050 or 2035, but they want to make sure that we have a program in place that will support them over that time frame, and it is very important to the every next order that we achieve. So, believe it or not, the competition for today\u2019s airplanes is often built around the future plans that we have with respect to sustainability. And I love where we\u2019re going on that and the story we -- that we have for our customers. Innovation is strong in every way. I mentioned the MQ-25, the T-7A. Future capabilities with respect to the next development program, we\u2019ve invested a lot. We continue to invest a lot. It\u2019s more important to me that we get our development tools where they need to be, demonstrate manufacturing capability and capacity where we need to be before we call out the spec on the next new commercial airplane. So, I remain focused on that as a priority, and so far, so good. Talent, we were stable over the course of \u201821. Turnover was managed I think quite well and quite aggressively. And so, I feel good about that and our ability to hire as we move forward. But, I will also acknowledge that there are shortages out there in critical skills, and we have to be very competitive in order to get them. I\u2019ll highlight the priorities we have. I don\u2019t think any of them should surprise anybody. They may look boring with respect to words like stability, safety, quality management. But that is still our focus, and we\u2019re going to be relentless about it. This is a very important year as we begin the year and then exit the year where we can predict to customers and to all of you the deliveries of our airplanes and ensure the quality is what it needs to be, et cetera. And culturally, our team is getting closer to their work than they\u2019ve ever been. We feel good about that. And we invest. We\u2019re investing heavily in the future capabilities of our Company. So, that\u2019s it with respect to my upfront comments. I\u2019ll turn it over to Brian. We can go through the quarter\u2019s performance and then a little more time for Q&A.

We\u2019re optimistic about how we\u2019re positioned entering into 2022 and have high confidence in the long-term strength of the Company. We remain focused on solidifying our business for long-term success. The lessons we\u2019ve learned and the changes we\u2019ve implemented in the last two years will help us to do that. We\u2019re driving safety, quality, stability into every corner of our operations to enable future growth. And we made solid progress against our goals over the last three months. In particular, as Dave mentioned, we\u2019re proceeding to get 737 MAX airplanes ready to deliver in China as early as the first quarter and follow the lead of our customers and regulators on next steps. On the 787, while we can\u2019t predict when deliveries will restart, we have made meaningful strides in addressing many of the non-conformances we identified. We have work remaining to do, and we continue to hold detailed productive discussions with the FAA every step of the way. Looking to our financials. Despite some of the near-term challenges, we generated positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter and believe free cash flow will continue to materially improve this year and into 2023. With this backdrop, we think of 2022 in three parts. First, we\u2019ll focus on reaching key milestones so that we can resume 737 deliveries to Chinese customers and restart 787 deliveries. Then, once we achieve these important milestones, we expect to see improvement in our performance metrics, including deliveries, revenue, margin and cash flow. And we intend to come back to you with detailed plans for the rest of the year and beyond. Finally, as we move through the second half of the year, our financial performance should start to accelerate. And we think there is a significant opportunity ahead for our Company return to sustainable growth. Net-net, we\u2019re well positioned at the start of the year and encouraged by the hope of a return to normalcy in 2022. Before I get into the detailed financial results, I want to make a few points on the current environment on slide 4. Let\u2019s start with the demand side. In the commercial market, we continue to see an overall broadening of the recovery starting with domestic traffic, which rebounded to around 90% of prepandemic levels in countries such as the U.S. and Brazil. In the U.S., domestic traffic nearly fully recovered at 94% of pre-COVID levels in November. December data suggests resilient traffic despite the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, but early 2022 bookings data indicate a more visible negative impact likely extending through February. Beyond that, we expect the recovery for the spring and summer seasons. Outside of the U.S., the recovery continues broadening in Europe and South America. However, further lockdowns have stagnated recovery in China, where we have seen traffic decrease considerably. Despite some near-term volatility, we\u2019re encouraged by airlines\u2019 plans for the spring and summer travel seasons. On the international front, traffic has improved throughout the year from more than 85% below 2019 levels to 60% as the year ended with a meaningful benefit from reopening of borders and lifting of travel restrictions. In particular, the transatlantic corridor showed improvement due to coordinated travel policies between the EU and the U.S. The commercial freighter market continues to be robust with 2021 cargo traffic 7% above prepandemic levels. We saw record freighter demand last year driven by both e-commerce growth and demand for faster, more reliable transport that airfreight can provide. And we\u2019re seeing the same steady recovery broadly in our commercial services business as well. Given this demand recovery, our customers are increasingly focused on their medium-term flight planning and continue to prioritize fleet modernization as an enabler to reduce carbon emissions and increase operating efficiency. New airplanes we deliver will be as much as 25% to 40% more fuel efficient with commensurate reductions in emissions compared to the airplanes they replace. And as oil prices remain high, our customers are keenly aware of these benefits. Overall, our projections", "doc_id": "960b8f00-2976-4534-aa0d-9cbe90445e26", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "67bd8fd861da50e2b72eb32e8b7f745d83d94d84385f5869d912c8fe22dea144", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 141807, "end": 146045, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "2e8f9f6e-d215-4b2b-80f1-0dafcac4b19f", "3": "875039e4-fb47-4acf-9b61-d4231a0c7ff6"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "875039e4-fb47-4acf-9b61-d4231a0c7ff6": {"__data__": {"text": "high, our customers are keenly aware of these benefits. Overall, our projections for the three-phase commercial market recovery remain unchanged, and we still assume pass-through traffic will return to 2019 levels in the 2023 to 2024 time frame. We continue to see domestic traffic lead the recovery followed by intra-regional and then long-haul international routes. Long-term fundamentals that support demand for air traffic remain intact as we continue to project average traffic growth of mid-single digits over the long term. In the defense and space markets, we\u2019re seeing stable demand. We continue to monitor the federal budget process in the U.S. and see strong bipartisan support for national security, including Boeing products and services. While governments around the world remain focused on COVID-19, security spending remains a priority given global threats. On the supply side, with our production at relatively low rates and higher-than-normal inventory levels, the supply chain is currently not a constraint. However, as we look forward to the industry recovering and future production rate increases, our supply chain remains a key watch item due to raw material and labor availability as well as logistical challenges. We regularly monitor supplier health and have risk mitigation plans in place for critical components. As we prepare for future rate production increases, we will continue to prioritize operational stability across the value stream. Long term, the markets we serve are robust, and we remain confident in the fundamentals of our business and the growth of the industry. With that, let\u2019s turn to the financials on page 5 -- slide 5. Fourth quarter revenue of $14.8 billion declined 3%. And the core operating loss in the quarter was $4.5 billion, resulting in a $7.69 loss per share. We generated positive operating cash flow of over $700 million in the fourth quarter, driven by 737 deliveries and favorable receipt timing in BDS. Let\u2019s now look to Commercial Airplanes on slide 6. Commercial order activity picked up significantly in 2021 as airlines are positioning for the recovery, particularly in the narrowbody and freighter markets. In total for the year, we booked 909 gross Commercial Airplane orders, including 749 orders for the 737 MAX. We also booked a record number of orders on our freighter airplanes. And we ended the year with 11 straight months of positive net orders. We appreciate every order from our broad customer base, including United, Southwest, Alaska, UPS and FedEx. We are also honored that Akasa, Allegiant and 777 partners recently selected Boeing to support their future fleets. We had over 4,200 airplanes in backlog at the end of 2021 valued at $297 billion. Fourth quarter revenue was $4.8 billion, essentially flat, primarily driven by higher 737 deliveries, partially offset by lower widebody deliveries and less favorable mix. Operating losses of $4.5 billion were primarily driven by charges on the 787 program, resulting in a negative margin rate. 787 deliveries remain paused, and we had 110 airplanes in inventory at the end of the quarter. As you know, last year, we set out on a comprehensive program to ensure every 787 airplane in our production system conforms to our exacting specifications. We resolved many of the non-conformances and, we\u2019re finalizing our work on the remaining items. We also continue to focus on fulfilling the requirements and expectations of the FAA, and we\u2019ll follow their lead on the timing of resuming deliveries. While this effort has inevitably impacted our deliveries to customers and our near-term financial performance, we are fully confident is the right thing to do for our future. In the fourth quarter, we determined that the activities required to resume deliveries and the rework that will be needed on each airplane and inventory will take longer than previously expected, resulting in further delays in customer delivery dates. We regret the impact these delays have had on our customers and are working closely with each of them to support their fleet planning needs. Consequently, we\u2019re producing at very low rates, and we\u2019ll continue to do so until deliveries resume, gradually returning to five airplanes per month over time. From a financial impact", "doc_id": "875039e4-fb47-4acf-9b61-d4231a0c7ff6", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ab1e7c9f16e5cb42f34dbb350ac7bae8c1954cb4c4b21e740ab1f76a48cbbb50", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 146037, "end": 150315, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "960b8f00-2976-4534-aa0d-9cbe90445e26", "3": "7ada4a1c-02bd-4810-b2b1-0baf3084aa2a"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "7ada4a1c-02bd-4810-b2b1-0baf3084aa2a": {"__data__": {"text": "resume, gradually returning to five airplanes per month over time. From a financial impact standpoint, we now anticipate 787 abnormal costs will be approximately $2 billion, with most being incurred by the end of 2023. This estimate increased by approximately $1 billion from last quarter due to the additional rework requirements and lower production rates continuing longer than previously expected. We recorded $285 million of these abnormal costs in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we recorded a $3.5 billion noncash charge in the quarter to write down unamortized deferred production costs, primarily due to estimated customer compensation for the longer delivery delays. It is important to keep in mind that from an economic standpoint, cash margins on the 787 remain positive. While the additional costs and customer considerations will put some downward pressure on cash margins in the near term, cash margins are expected to remain positive and significantly improve over time. We remain very confident in the future success of the 787, and it remains one of our most compelling programs. Importantly, none of the issues we\u2019re addressing have raised immediate safety of flight concerns or impacted the capabilities of the in-service fleet. We received gross orders for 21 airplanes last year, and we see a long runway ahead. We are working diligently to ensure that we are well positioned as demand recovers and accelerates in the future. Moving on to the 737 MAX program. The MAX is now approved to fly in over 185 countries. As mentioned, we continue to prepare airplanes for deliveries as early as the first quarter, subject to customer and regulatory approvals in China. We also delivered 245 737 MAX airplanes last year, and we\u2019ve steadily ramped up production. And we are now producing at 27 airplanes per month on our way to 31 per month early this year. As you look to ramp both our production rate and delivery gains this year, we will continue to monitor the impact of Omicron on resource availability. We currently have 335 737 MAX airplanes in inventory and still anticipate delivering most of these airplanes by the end of 2023. Timing and pace of deliveries to Chinese customers are also critical assumptions to our delivery outlook. 737 abnormal costs and the liability for 737 MAX customer considerations are largely behind us. We expect the majority of the remaining $2.9 billion liability to be liquidated this year with less than 10% of the total estimate left to be negotiated. On the 777X, we continue to progress through our rigorous and comprehensive test program. We have flown over 1,800 flight hours through the end of 2021. We also completed engine and airplane performance testing, and the airplane continues to perform in line with our customer commitments. Our customers recognize the compelling economics and sustainability benefits this airplane offers. We remain engaged with the FAA and other global regulators throughout this process. We\u2019re working towards reaching Type Inspection Authorization or TIA, which is a pacing item for us to begin FAA certification flight testing. We are still anticipating delivery of the first airplane in late 2023. Also, we are currently offering the freighter version of our 777X airplane to customers. And we\u2019ll keep you updated as we progress on sales campaigns and conclude our launch timing evaluation. As a result of increasing freighter demand, we plan to increase the combined 777, 777X production rate from two to three per month this year and expect 2022 deliveries to be relatively in line with last year. Let\u2019s now move to Defense, Space & Security on slide 7. Fourth quarter revenue was $5.9 billion, down 14%, and operating margin was negative 4.4%. These results were primarily driven by lower volume and less favorable performance across the portfolio, including a $402 million pretax charge on the KC-46 Tanker program. The charge is primarily driven by evolving customer requirements for a remote vision system as well as factory and supply chain disruptions, including the impact of COVID.

The BDS backlog increased to $60 billion. During the quarter, BDS also delivered on critical customer milestones. Overall, we remain optimistic about our defense business. Now, let\u2019s turn to Global Services results on slide 8. Fourth quarter Global Services revenue was $4.3 billion, up 15%, and operating margin was 9.3%. Results were driven by higher commercial services volume and favorable mix. Earnings were impacted by a $220 million inventory impairment in the fourth quarter. We received $6 billion in orders during the quarter, taking the BGS backlog to $20 billion. We also delivered the 50th 767-300 converted freighter and announced plans to add 10 new converted freighter lines. Our services business has shown great resilience in part due to the balance of both defense and commercial offerings. Let\u2019s move to slide 9 and cover the full year financials. Full year revenue of $62.3 billion improved 7% versus prior year. The core operating loss was negative $4.1 billion, an improvement of $10.1 billion. The resulting core loss per share was $9.44, primarily driven by the charge on the 787. Operating cash flow was negative $3.4 billion, an improvement of $15 billion. The in-year cash usage was driven by 787 inventory build, 737 customer considerations and interest payments, partially offset by commercial deliveries, order activity, favorable timing of cash receipts at BDS and tax refunds related to the CARES Act. Now, let\u2019s turn to slide 10 to cover cash and debt. We ended the fourth quarter with strong liquidity, comprised of $16.2 billion of cash and marketable securities on the balance sheet and access to $14.7 billion across our bank credit facilities, which remain undrawn. Our debt balance decreased by $4.3 billion from the end of the third quarter to $58.1 billion driven by the early pay down of the delayed draw term loan. We remain committed to reducing debt levels, and our investment-grade credit rating is a priority. Please turn to the next slide for a look at 2022 and key drivers of the business. As you look ahead, 2022 performance will be driven by the commercial market recovery, return to delivery for the 787 and 737 MAX in China, production system and delivery stability and U.S.-China trade relations. Our efforts to stabilize our production system, including the supply chain and improve our delivery predictability remain top priorities. These activities will be paramount to our success. Looking broadly across our enterprise, we\u2019re maintaining, in some cases, expanding key investments in our people, technology, manufacturing capabilities and strategic partnerships. We\u2019re advancing our development of the MAX 7, MAX 10 and 777X programs, all while continuing to invest in digital capabilities to support our next commercial airplane program. In BDS, we\u2019re progressing on the MQ-25, T-7A, Commercial Crew and several other key development programs. As we invest, we continue to be laser-focused on our business transformation efforts to drive quality, productivity and cash flow. Now, let\u2019s take a look at the key drivers of 2022 revenue and cash. We anticipate revenue increase primarily driven by higher commercial airplane deliveries on the 737 and 787 programs. That said, revenue will be impacted by 787 customer considerations and delivering 737 airplanes that were previously remarketed. We are forecasting stable revenue in our defense business and solid growth in our services business as the commercial market continues to improve. Moving to cash. We still expect to generate positive free cash flow in the year. The key driver remains higher 737 and 787 delivery volume. Keep in mind the working capital benefit from delivering airplanes from inventory will be partially offset by a lower advances in progress payments balance. We still anticipate a significant burn down of our advances balance this year, which we expect to be more front-end loaded in line with customer discussions. Additionally, cash flow will remain impacted by timing of receipts and expenditures. As you may recall, we booked orders last year that filled near-term skyline positions, and those unique receipts may not continue at the same levels this year.

From a phasing standpoint, we anticipate the first quarter to be our lowest quarter of the year for deliveries, revenue, earnings and cash flow. First quarter cash flow could look similar to the usage we saw in 1Q \u201821, driven by unfavorable receipt timing, excess advance payment burn down, resource availability due to the Omicron variant and normal seasonality. We remain confident that our free cash flow will improve in the second quarter and will meaningfully accelerate in the back half of the year as we achieve the key delivery milestones that I previously outlined. As we look to the future, we expect 2023 cash flow will be materially higher than 2022. We look forward to sharing more details on our plan as soon as we can. In closing, the business environment remains dynamic, but we\u2019ve made important progress. We are confident that we\u2019re on the right path, we\u2019re taking the right steps to drive stability and making the right investments to ensure the business is well positioned for future growth. With that, closing comments? Yes. No further comments. I\u2019d like to turn it over to questions and give all our time to that. Thanks.  Our first question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead. So maybe can you help us understand the $3.5 billion of charges tied to the 787 in addition to the abnormal cost of $2 billion through 2023? That\u2019s up $1 billion from Q3 as you mentioned, Brian. What does this imply for the future profit and cash tied to the 787 program? How do we think about those deliveries going back up to 5 and then timing of those deliveries restarting because some of your customers have talked about an April time frame? Thanks, Sheila. So, on the 787 $3.5 billion, we previously described a pretty labor-intensive rework solution on the door surrounds. And in the quarter, we determined that this rework was going to be needed to be formed on all of the airplanes inventory. So, the abnormal is $1 billion higher and will mostly go through 2023 because of this higher rework cost and the production rates being lower for longer. This, in turn, has our delivery slide to the right. So, more airplanes will be impacted, not just the ones in inventory. And we provided for estimated customer concessions because of these delays, which drove the $3.5 billion charge. While this hurts in the near term, we still believe it\u2019s the right thing to do because long term, we\u2019re going to sell a lot of these 787s for decades. So, we just got to work our way through this. In terms of getting back to 5, so we got to first get cleared to deliver, and then we\u2019re going to gradually work our way to a point we\u2019re going to get back up to 5. We don\u2019t have the time frame, but we think that the first step is getting the first one out the door. On the April time frame, Dave, maybe you could comment on the customer implications on that one. Well, the April time frame is all I\u2019ll say is the customers know everything that we do. We share the same regulator. They are in our factories looking at the airplanes every day. So, they know exactly what\u2019s going on and where it is. I don\u2019t want to get ahead of anybody with respect to speculating the day we pick it. That\u2019s up to the FAA, and we\u2019re going to let them do what they have to do. Otherwise, I think Brian described this charge exactly the way it is. Next, we\u2019ll go to Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please go ahead.Cai von  Yes. Thanks so much. So, maybe to follow up on Sheila\u2019s question. Of the $3.5 billion, you mentioned that\u2019s noncash, how much of it turns into cash? How much of it is the abnormal -- the $1 billion increase? And how much of it is customer considerations? And when do you expect those to be paid out? Yes. Sure, Cai. So, the $1 billion increase on the abnormal is separate from the $3.5 billion. And in terms of the $3.5 billion, that will play out over a", "doc_id": "71ccbaf5-06a1-4b6e-89d4-ddeede38337f", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "057fd7825659c42a26e22e92c7968c6f68ac9bb8e39ecfe840373030f5fd051c", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 158996, "end": 162933, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "374a34fd-c2df-4e47-9a5d-a5c3ea7c13a2", "3": "cb7e54f4-5503-457c-abf6-8c5204cfb044"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "cb7e54f4-5503-457c-abf6-8c5204cfb044": {"__data__": {"text": "billion. And in terms of the $3.5 billion, that will play out over a longer period of time, particularly as we have discussions with customers. Some of that might be accelerated in the near term, but overall, it\u2019s going to take us time for that cash flow to go out. It will take years. In terms of how much is customer concessions, we\u2019re not going to talk about all of the pieces. Trust that as we closed the quarter, we took all the estimates in terms of what we think was going to happen both for contractual and non-contractual concessions. And it\u2019s embedded into our closing position. And we feel good about that, and now we just have to work through with our customers to -- and then start delivering. In terms of the abnormal, again, that cash flow will likely go out over the next two years as most of that will be behind us as we get out of 2023. The only other context is that unlike in the case of the MAX, we do have an experience, unfortunately, that we can draw from in setting these estimates, and most importantly, the management of the concessions with our customers over time. So, what we\u2019ve posted and the way we think about it is largely based on that historical experience, of course, with the MAX. So, I feel like we\u2019ve probably bounded it pretty reasonably. Our next question is from Myles Walton with UBS. On the 37 MAX given the lead times in the supply chain, I know that you\u2019re evaluating the timing of further increases, but can you get much above 31 a month before the end of the year if you haven\u2019t made that decision yet? And obviously, suppliers are thinking that you\u2019re looking to the 40 level as you leave \u201822, maybe a little clarification there. I\u2019ll leave the supplier and the increase to Dave. I want to take the near-term production delivery MAX question head-on because it\u2019s largely unchanged from where we were last quarter as what we expect to happen in 2022. We\u2019ve got 335 units of inventory. And that will liquidate through the year at a quarterly rate that is pretty similar to what we did last quarter. And then, the production ramp, as you know, Myles, is going to go from 26 to 31 fairly soon. So, we all think that\u2019s going to play out. And again, it\u2019s similar to what we had thought last quarter. The one watch item that we have in the first quarter is any disruption on Omicron that might have a bit of a slower start, but we\u2019ll work our way through that. The total profile is largely unchanged. And we\u2019re quite confident in the demand. And maybe in terms of further rate increase supply chain, I\u2019ll let Dave comment on that. Well, just the prognosis that we can move it up and based on what everybody seems to want to believe. We are going to be very aggressive with our supply chain to get buffers at every corner so that we can do it. And then the question is, do we do it? So, right now, we have fewer supply constraints probably than the industry simply because we\u2019ve got this big finished goods inventory that\u2019s going to carry us for the better part of the calendar year and then even a little bit into next year. So, we\u2019ll take advantage of that, and then we\u2019ll ask the supply chain to build buffer, both on our premise and in theirs to protect upside. That\u2019s the way we\u2019re thinking about it. Can you talk about that next release, the next uptick this quarter? Can I talk about the next...

With me are Jim Umpleby, Chairman and CEO; Andrew Bonfield, Chief Financial Officer; Kyle Epley, Vice President of the Global Finance Services Division; and Rob Rengel, Senior Manager and Investor Relations. Earlier this morning, we issued our earnings news release. You can find the release and accompanying slides on caterpillar.com in the Investors section under Events and Presentations. In the back of the slide, you\u2019ll find supplemental information on dealer inventory and order backlog. We\u2019ve copyrighted this call. Please don\u2019t use any portion without a prior written approval. Now on slide 2. During our call, we\u2019ll make forward-looking statements. These are subject to a host of risks and uncertainties. For more information about the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to vary materially from any forward-looking statements, please refer to our SEC filings, including our 10-Q filings for the most recent quarters. On today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll also refer to non-GAAP numbers. For a reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers to the appropriate U.S. GAAP numbers, please see the appendix of the earnings call slides. This morning, we announced profit per share of $3.91 for the fourth quarter of 2021. That compares with a profit per share of $1.42 in the fourth quarter of 2020. Our adjusted profit per share was $2.69 in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared with $2.12 in the fourth quarter of 2020. Adjusted profit per share for both quarters excluded restructuring and mark-to-market gains or losses for remeasurement of pension and other post-employment benefit plans. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we had $1.19 per share of remeasurement gain and $0.03 per share of net restructuring income due to a gain on the sale of a facility. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we had $0.63 per share of remeasurement losses and $0.07 per share of restructuring expenses. Please keep in mind, to a date, we\u2019ll announce our first quarter earnings, April 28, and we\u2019ll host our next Investor Day, May 17th. And with that, turn to slide 3. We\u2019ll give the call over to Jim Umpleby. Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us.  I\u2019d like to start by recognizing our global team for their continued resilience and hard work in what proved to be a challenging and dynamic environment. We\u2019re proud that we achieved our best year on record for employee safety for the third year in a row. In 2021, we continue to execute our strategy for long-term profitable growth while striving to meet strong customer demand. I\u2019ll briefly cover a number of topics. I\u2019ll start with my perspective on the quarter, then I\u2019ll give a brief update on our supply chain, followed by comments on services and our end markets before closing with an update on Caterpillar\u2019s sustainability journey. We were encouraged by the continued strong customer demand in the quarter. Sales and revenues rose in all regions and in the three primary segments due to volume gains and favorable price. And similar to the third quarter, absent the continuation of supply chain constraints, our top line would have been even stronger. On the other hand, our margins were lower than we expected, primarily because of two factors. First, freight costs were higher than expected due to inflationary pressures as well as our decision to increase the use of premium freight to meet as much customer demand as possible. The second factor was production inefficiencies. As I mentioned, underlying demand is stronger than we can currently supply due to ongoing supply chain constraints. We made the decision to keep our plants open and fully staffed to best serve our customers and meet as much demand as possible. We believe it\u2019s the right decision to encourage some short-term margin impact rather than take actions that might limit our ability to more fully satisfy demand when supply chain conditions start to improve. We also continue to redirect components all through our assembly processes and optimize where we can. Some of these actions aimed", "doc_id": "9ba62b13-4513-43e1-8352-e329082062de", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "59e93ae5bd902f25f32d22858b89a03662ea80193349c0f0e0a4bdd46755de9f", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 166813, "end": 170907, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "cb7e54f4-5503-457c-abf6-8c5204cfb044", "3": "0055422a-f9fa-4902-943a-2421c5950f46"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "0055422a-f9fa-4902-943a-2421c5950f46": {"__data__": {"text": "all through our assembly processes and optimize where we can. Some of these actions aimed at maintaining our production flexibility come with additional short-term costs. When the supply chain bottlenecks begin to ease, we expect to be well positioned to increase our production to more fully meet demand and gain operating leverage from higher volume. Material costs also impacted us this quarter, but unlike freight and inefficiencies, it was within the range we had anticipated. As you know, we implemented price increases during 2021. We\u2019re taking further action in 2022 with the intent to offset the impact of underlying inflation. That\u2019s the general picture. Andrew will provide more details on our margins and how the combination of supply chain pressures and pricing will likely affect the cadence of our quarterly margins in 2022. Now on slide 4. Our top line rose by 23%. The primary drivers of the volume gains were increases in sales to users, including the original equipment and services and changes in dealer inventory. For the full year 2021, services sales grew 17% to $19 billion. Services growth in 2021 benefited from investments in our digital capabilities and the increased focus we and our dealers placed on meeting customer needs for services, particularly aftermarket parts. We saw significant increases in 2021 in e-commerce sales and sales of customer value agreements or CVAs and in prioritized service events or PSEs. In 2021, our e-commerce orders increased significantly, and now we have critical mass in connectivity with more than 1.2 million connected assets. It\u2019s encouraging to see services sales in 2021 higher than in 2019 when our total company -- while our total company sales in 2021 remained lower than in 2019. We continue to strive to meet our aspirational target of doubling services to $28 billion by 2026. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2020, sales to users rose 7%. Gains were across the three segments. For machines, including Construction Industries and Resource Industries, sales to users rose 5%. For Energy & Transportation, sales to users increased 12%. Sales to users in Construction Industries rose by 4%, with double-digit growth in EAME and Latin America. In North America, residential construction remained strong in the elevated housing construction, while nonresidential demand continued to improve at a slower pace. In Asia Pacific, end-user demand slowed, reflecting the expected moderation in China construction. However, excluding China, sales to users were positive in Asia Pacific driven by favorable commodity prices and government stimulus. In Resource Industries, sales to users rose by 10%. Mining saw healthy gains in the quarter, supported by strong commodity prices and the replacement of aging equipment. Sales to users increased versus the prior year in heavy construction and quarry and aggregates for the third straight quarter. In Energy & Transportation, sales to users were up across all applications versus the prior year. We saw double-digit growth in industrial and transportation, although from a low base. We experienced strength across many applications for industrial, and international rail deliveries benefited transportation sales as expected. Oil and gas grew from demand for both reciprocating engines and turbines. Finally, power generation sales to users increased as data center demand remains strong. Overall, total sales to users growth in the quarter moderated versus the second and third quarters. As a reminder, the impact of the pandemic lessened in the fourth quarter of 2020. In addition, the supply chain challenges have constrained our ability to fully meet end-user demand. As independent businesses, dealers make their own decisions about their inventories. Changes in dealer inventories drove about a $1 billion tailwind to sales compared with last year. Dealer inventory was nearly flat in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter of this year. In the fourth quarter of 2020, dealers decreased their inventory by about $1.1 billion. To put it in context, our year-end dealer inventory in 2021 also finished about flat with year-end 2020, as we expected. Dealer inventories are generally near the low end of the typical range due to strong customer demand and our supply chain challenges. Currently, availability is extended for some products due to the shortage of semiconductors and other components.

With the exception of China, end-user demand for our equipment remains strong. Turning to slide 5. In 2021, we met our 2019 Investor Day target for adjusted operating profit margins for the third year in a row. We also met our target for free cash flow for Machinery, Energy & Transportation or ME&T. Our strong cash flow enabled us to return $5 billion to shareholders this year through dividends and share repurchases. We paid a higher dividend annually for 28 consecutive years and are proud of our status as a dividend aristocrat. We expect to continue to return substantially all of ME&T free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases over time. Next, on slide 6, I\u2019ll share some high-level assumptions for the full year. First, in 2022, based on what we know today, we expect to achieve our Investor Day targets for adjusted operating profit margins and ME&T free cash flow. That said, the environment remains uncertain due to COVID and other issues, including continuing supply chain disruptions, freight and material cost inflation and labor availability. Our focus is long-term profitable growth. Despite the challenging environment, we continue to invest in services, electrification, autonomy, alternative fuels and digital technology, all of which support our strategy. Now, I\u2019ll describe our outlook for key end markets this year. Demand remains strong as demonstrated by robust orders. In addition, we\u2019re receiving positive input from our customers and dealers. A key variable remains the supply chain, namely to what degree can we fully meet strong customer demand. In Construction Industries in North America, residential construction continues to be the main growth engine with nonresidential also improving. We believe the U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will begin to fuel increased investments in capital equipment late this year, into 2023 and beyond. In China, we expect the industry for excavators above 10 tons to return to 2019 levels, reflecting weakness in housing construction. We expect the balance of Asia Pacific to have good growth, fueled by higher investments in infrastructure. Turning to EAME. Positive fundamentals include government stimulus actions, construction confidence, new orders and commodity prices. Latin America is expected to benefit from construction activity in mining, supported by commodity prices, although strong inflation could make it more challenging. In Resource Industries, we anticipate elevated commodity prices will support continuing improvement in demand for mining products and services. We also expect growth in heavy construction and quarry and aggregates to continue in 2022. We now currently operate autonomously on 18 sites on 3 continents with more than 500 large mining trucks and have now moved more than 4 billion tons. Technology and autonomy offerings deliver significant benefits across the board, from boosting safety and productivity to more consistent and efficient operations. Autonomous operations enable higher machine utilization, leading to reductions in idle time and nonproductive fuel burn. In Energy & Transportation, we see improved sales across most applications, and we had strong order rates, including for large engines in the fourth quarter. While we expect our oil and gas customers to continue to display capital discipline, we do expect growth in our reciprocating engines and aftermarket services for oil and gas. We see growth in reciprocating engines for power generation with strength across many applications. Industrial, which includes engines for our own equipment and loose engines sold to customers, is projected to grow across many applications, including construction, agriculture and electric power. We expect a modest increase in transportation, primarily in rail services. We also anticipate growth in Marine from a low base as customers update aging fleets. In 2022, Solar is expected to be impacted by the dampening industry cycle. We expect Solar\u2019s new equipment sales to be lower this year, which will be partially offset by continued services growth. Solar is experiencing healthy inquiry activity, which indicates the likely recovery in customer deliveries in the late 2022 and into 2023. Now on slide 7.

In 2021, Caterpillar and our customers announced a number of projects that will help contribute to a lower carbon future. I\u2019ll highlight several more that occurred since our last earnings call. In November, Newmont announced a strategic alliance with Caterpillar to deliver a fully automated zero-emissions mining equipment and technology. The investment encompasses a U.S. surface mine and an Australian underground mine while also deploying Caterpillar MineStar across all Newmont sites. We also announced a three-year collaboration with Microsoft and Ballard to demonstrate a power system with large format hydrogen fuel cells to produce backup power for Microsoft data centers. Caterpillar is providing the system integration, electronics and controls that form the central structure of the power solution, which will be fueled by low carbon intensity hydrogen. The project is backed by the U.S. Department of Energy. In December, Progress Rail entered into a memorandum of understanding with BNSF and Chevron to advance the demonstration on BNSF\u2019s line of a locomotive powered by hydrogen fuel cells. Progress Rail plans to design and build a prototype hydrogen fuel-cell locomotive with Chevron developing the infrastructure to support it. Earlier this month, Teck Resources, one of Canada\u2019s leading mining companies, announced a partnership with Caterpillar to deploy 30 zero-emissions large haul trucks, including Cat 794 ultra-class trucks at their mining operations beginning in 2027. This collaboration will support their goals to reduce the carbon intensity of their operations by 33% by 2030 and be carbon-neutral by 2050. And finally, Union Pacific is purchasing 10 Progress Rail battery-electric locomotives, making them our fourth customer for this new technology. In railroads, in California, in Nebraska, they will be tested in diverse weather conditions and evaluated for broader deployment in support of Union Pacific\u2019s emissions reduction goals. We\u2019re excited about the opportunities associated with the energy transition, which includes rising demand for commodities used in electric vehicles and other applications, benefiting Resource Industries. The significant infrastructure investments associated with the energy transition also support growth in Construction Industries. In addition, the increased demand for a number of products in our Energy & Transportation segment, including distributed power generation and our integrated systems and solutions to help our customers meet their climate-related objectives. Caterpillar continues to invest in research and development to support a wide variety of fuel types, energy storage and hybrid solutions. In summary, we\u2019re continuing to execute our strategy for long-term profitable growth. The three core elements of the strategy remain: services, expanded offerings and operational excellence. Services growth and our record safety performance are among the many highlights of 2021. We remain committed to a reduced carbon future, both in our operations and helping customers reach their climate-related goals. We continue to introduce products and services that facilitate fuel transition, increase operational efficiency and reduce emissions. While we continue to face supply chain challenges that negatively impacted our top line and our fourth quarter margin performance, we\u2019re focusing on meeting as much customer demand as possible and remain encouraged by the continuation of strong end-market demand. Our team delivered 2021 adjusted operating profit margins and ME&T free cash flow consistent with the long-term targets we set at our 2019 Investor Day, while continuing to invest in our long-term strategy for profitable growth. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Andrew. Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll begin with a recap of Caterpillar\u2019s fourth quarter results, including the performance of each segment, then I\u2019ll comment on the balance sheet and cash flow, before concluding with a few assumptions about the first quarter and full year of 2022. Starting with the fourth quarter on slide 8. Our sales and revenues rose by 23% or $2.6 billion to $13.8 billion. Volume growth led the way and was broad-based as demand remained strong. Operating profit increased by 17% to $1.6 billion as volume growth and favorable", "doc_id": "3cfed0e9-4bea-4d8b-8282-506b05e4769c", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "a0976c913647dade81645f2cdaa31e3f4d0a78013543a1021d1c51e7c8a8aed5", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 179760, "end": 184207, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "0174c025-a8f8-461f-a2d7-86818e60d147", "3": "ac84a3aa-8e49-4bac-9ded-c0f9c321a89a"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "ac84a3aa-8e49-4bac-9ded-c0f9c321a89a": {"__data__": {"text": "Operating profit increased by 17% to $1.6 billion as volume growth and favorable price were partially offset by freight, material and short-term incentive compensation headwinds. As Jim has mentioned, operating margins were lower than we had anticipated, primarily due to elevated freight costs and plant inefficiencies, which I\u2019ll discuss further in a few moments. Fourth quarter profit per share was $3.91 compared to $1.42 last year. We had our usual impacts from mark-to-market accounting for remeasurement of pension and OPEB plans. That included $1.19 per share favorable in the fourth quarter of this year compared to $0.63 per share unfavorable last year. Restructuring was actually a net income of $19 million in the quarter, due to the gain on the sale of the facility. In addition, some of our planned restructuring activities that we\u2019d originally expected to complete in the quarter will push back into 2022. We reported adjusted profit per share of $2.69 in the fourth quarter compared to $2.12 last year. This performance included a lower-than-expected global tax rate and some discrete tax items, which, together, added approximately $0.36 to fourth quarter profit per share. Now on slide 9. As we had anticipated, the top line for the fourth quarter was the strongest of the year, coming in slightly better than normal seasonality would imply. Dealer inventory provided about a $1 billion tailwind versus the comparable quarter in 2020 when dealers reduced their inventories by $1.1 billion. Sales to users growth decelerated a bit sequentially, but remained strong despite a tougher comparison period, particularly in China. Price realization strengthened as we saw the benefit of additional price actions begin to flow through. Services continue to be a bright spot. I want to take a moment to provide some color on dealer inventory. Caterpillar dealers typically hold between 3 and 4 months worth of inventory based on projected sales for the next 12 months. For the past year, they\u2019ve been near the low end of that range. Because of strong sales to end users and supply chain constraints, dealers have prioritized customer orders over building inventory. As a result, dealers have been unable to restock as would have been their normal practice. Given the current constrained environment, we don\u2019t expect to see a significant benefit from dealer restocking in 2022. Fourth quarter sales and revenues increased in every region. In North America, our largest region, sales increased by 27%, with strong growth in all three primary segments, but led by Construction Industries and Resource Industries. In EAME, sales rose by 24% as fundamentals remain strong. Latin America sales grew by 38% from a low base. Asia Pacific sales increased by 9% as gains in Energy & Transportation and Resource Industries more than offset lower revenues in Construction Industries. Excluding China, Construction Industries sales in the regions grew versus the prior year\u2019s quarter. Just to remind you, the quarterly sales profile for China in 2020 was very different from the normal seasonable pattern, with a strong second half due to the timing of stimulus activity. In 2021, we have returned to the more typical profile of a stronger first half of the year ahead of the selling season. This is made for a particular tough comparison as China sales were abnormally strong in the fourth quarter of 2020. Now, let\u2019s review the bottom line on slide 10. Fourth quarter operating profit increased by $231 million or 17%. Compared to the prior year, strong volume and favorable price realization were the principal drivers of the increase. Higher manufacturing costs and SG&A and R&D expenses partially offset these gains. Acceleration in freight, manufacturing inefficiencies and material costs drove the manufacturing cost increases. The freight costs included both inflation and standard rates and the increased use of premium freight. The reinstatement of short-term incentive compensation had an impact on manufacturing costs and SG&A and R&D expenses, albeit at a slower rate than previous quarters. Beginning in the second quarter, we told you that we had expected price realization to offset higher manufacturing costs for machines in 2021. We have come up just short of that goal as the unfavorable impacts of", "doc_id": "ac84a3aa-8e49-4bac-9ded-c0f9c321a89a", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "9cae25cf97d261e02dbc2e4e7445e7e1bd5c1dc681bf1bc683178dfa5b72918b", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 184209, "end": 188522, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "3cfed0e9-4bea-4d8b-8282-506b05e4769c", "3": "adb1f466-17a5-43cb-9465-2c92d92984ac"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "adb1f466-17a5-43cb-9465-2c92d92984ac": {"__data__": {"text": "2021. We have come up just short of that goal as the unfavorable impacts of rising freight costs and the manufacturing inefficiencies during the fourth quarter were more significant than we had expected. As we had noted previously, due to taking price action later in the year, we had expected a lag in Energy & Transportation price realization, so material cost increases and sharply rising freight costs negatively impacted Energy & Transportation\u2019s margins more significantly than they did for the machine groups. Moving to margins. The adjusted operating profit margin was 11.4%, a decrease of 140 basis points, with short-term incentive compensation expense, a headwind of roughly 150 basis points of margin in the quarter. As both Jim and I have acknowledged, margins for the fourth quarter deteriorated by more than we had expected. To provide a bit more perspective, we typically see margins decrease sequentially by between 100 to 200 basis points from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. However, in the fourth quarter of 2021, the spike in freight costs, along with the plant inefficiencies that Jim described, caused an additional unfavorable impact of around 100 basis points or so. Most of this was due to the need to ship components using premium freight and factory inefficiencies that resulted from challenges caused by component shortages as we prioritize meeting customer demand. We believe that these margin headwinds are temporary and will only last as long as the supply chain challenges remain. Our price actions are designed to cover increases in underlying input costs, but do not anticipate factory inefficiencies or premium shipping, which had to be used to serve our customers. There\u2019s no doubt that this will impact some part of 2022, but it\u2019s impossible to be certain when these costs will abate. Now looking at the full year. Our adjusted operating profit margin was 13.7%. As Jim mentioned, we\u2019ve achieved our 2019 Investor Day margin target of adjusted operating profit margins being 300 to 600 basis points better at a comparable level of sales to the reference period of 2010 to 2016. We\u2019ve done so while investing in new product launches, services and sustainability. Of note, R&D expense, including higher short-term incentive compensation, increased by 19% for the full year. Our global effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 23% versus the 25% we had assumed previously. The improvement primarily related to changes in the geographic mix of profits from a tax perspective. Adjusted profit per share was $2.69, reflecting the stronger volume, favorable price as well as the lower-than-expected global tax rate. Moving to slide 11. Let\u2019s take a look at the segment performance, starting with Construction Industries. Sales increased by 27% in the fourth quarter to $5.7 billion, primarily driven by strong sales volume and favorable price realization. The improvement in volume was due to a smaller reduction year-over-year in dealer inventories and higher end-user demand. End-user demand improved in 3 of the 4 regions. In North America, we saw our largest sales growth as nonresidential demand continued to improve, and housing construction remained supportive. End-user demand eased in Asia Pacific due to the challenging comparatives in China that I spoke about earlier. The segment\u2019s fourth quarter profit increased by 25% to $788 million on higher sales volume and favorable price realization. Cost increases related to material and freight were more than offset by price increases. However, the segment\u2019s operating margin decreased by 30 basis points versus last year to 13.7% due to the headwinds of factory inefficiencies and higher short-term incentive compensation expense. Turning to slide 12. Resource Industries sales increased by 27% in the fourth quarter to $2.8 billion. The improvement was mostly due to higher end-user demand and favorable price. End-user demand increased in mining as well as heavy construction and quarry and aggregates. Fourth quarter profit for Resource Industries increased by 12% to $305 million. Increased manufacturing costs, including freight and material costs, and higher SG&A and R&D expenses were more than offset by higher sales volume and favorable price realization. The increase in", "doc_id": "adb1f466-17a5-43cb-9465-2c92d92984ac", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "a76a969ebb9253273b256e8cec27bdc9b19490f67ba0ac4922a3ac1ae34e8a82", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 188530, "end": 192828, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "ac84a3aa-8e49-4bac-9ded-c0f9c321a89a", "3": "1b561725-ec59-48aa-ac54-8b237b462380"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "1b561725-ec59-48aa-ac54-8b237b462380": {"__data__": {"text": "were more than offset by higher sales volume and favorable price realization. The increase in SG&A and R&D expenses was driven by investments and higher short-term incentive compensation. In Resource Industries, price realization takes longer to come through results because of the equipment\u2019s longer lead times between the time of an order and date of delivery. However, as we progress through 2022, we expect more benefits to flow through from the price increases we have taken. The segment\u2019s operating margin decreased by 150 basis points versus last year to 11.0%. Now on slide 13. Energy & Transportation sales increased by 19% to approximately $5.7 billion with sales up across all applications. That included a 22% sales increase in oil and gas, including aftermarket parts for reciprocating engines. Gas compression also supported reciprocating engine sales. Power generation sales increased by 7%, driven by reciprocating engine aftermarket part sales. Industrial sales rose by 29% with strength across many applications. Last, transportation rose by 17% on strong international rail deliveries and services in the quarter. Profit for Energy & Transportation decreased by 2% to $675 million. Volume and price gains were more than offset by higher manufacturing costs, short-term incentive compensation expense and investments in growth initiatives such as the energy transition. Keep in mind that the majority of our core investments in the energy transition, for example, in electrification, impact this segment. Freight cost increases were particularly significant in the quarter, driving the higher manufacturing costs. The segment\u2019s operating margin decreased by 250 basis points versus last year to 11.8%. On Slide 14, financial products had a very strong quarter. Revenue increased by 4% to $776 million. Segment profit increased by 27% year-over-year to $248 million. The year-over-year profit increase was partly due to continued strong demand for used equipment, where worldwide sales -- new sales were our highest on record in 2021. The segment also benefited from a lower provision for credit losses at Cat Financial.  Moving to our credit portfolio, it's in good shape as customer health indicators remain positive. Past dues continue to improve across all portfolio segments to 1.95%. That\u2019s down 154 basis points year-over-year and down 46 basis points compared to the third quarter. It\u2019s the lowest past due levels we\u2019ve seen in 15 years. New retail lending hit an 8-year high in the fourth quarter. On slide 15, ME&T free cash flow was $1.8 billion in the quarter, an increase of about $116 million versus the fourth quarter of last year. The increase was due to higher profit adjusted for noncash items, which includes higher accruals for short-term incentive compensation. ME&T generated $6 billion in free cash flow this year, almost double compared to the prior year and in line with our Investor Day target of between $4 billion and $8 billion. We recently declared a quarterly dividend of $1.11 per share or around $600 million per quarter. In 2021, we paid around $2.3 billion in dividends. We are proud of our dividend aristocrat status, which we maintained following the 8% quarterly increase announced in June of last year. We completed $1 billion in share repurchases in the fourth quarter for a total of $2.7 billion in 2021. In aggregate, we returned $5 billion to shareholders, which represents 83% of our ME&T free cash flow for 2021. Over the past four years, on average, we\u2019ve returned 99% of our ME&T free cash flow to shareholders. That aligns to our target to return substantially all of our ME&T free cash flow to shareholders over time. The Company ended the year with $9.3 billion in enterprise cash, a strong position. As always, given our captive finance organization, which helps our customers acquire our equipment, we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet as we prioritize our mid-A credit rating. Now on slide 16. In light of the fluid environment, we will continue to not provide guidance for our annual profit per share. However, to assist with modeling the Company, we\u2019ll", "doc_id": "1b561725-ec59-48aa-ac54-8b237b462380", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "3c6553fae66a4b327425dce52dd63cd1458ed81da661f3bd221c071278cf6d5c", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 192811, "end": 196945, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "adb1f466-17a5-43cb-9465-2c92d92984ac", "3": "7936ccf9-a4b0-4193-b606-bce795a6fe3e"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "7936ccf9-a4b0-4193-b606-bce795a6fe3e": {"__data__": {"text": "profit per share. However, to assist with modeling the Company, we\u2019ll continue to share some high-level assumptions for the upcoming quarter and full year. Looking to the first quarter, we expect the top line to increase versus the prior year on stronger end-user demand and higher prices. We also expect to see a dealer inventory increase, which would follow our normal seasonable pattern as dealers prepare for the spring selling season. However, we anticipate that increase will be slightly less than normal, given the supply chain constraints and the high levels of committed orders. For the full year, we expect the environment to support strong end-user demand and higher pricing. The extent that we\u2019ll be able to fulfill that demand will be impacted by the supply chain challenges we\u2019ve discussed today. As these alleviate, we would expect to see an acceleration in sales to end users. As we have noted, our order books and backlog are robust, but we do expect the supply chain to constrain our volumes. Before I discuss margins, I want to highlight how unusual the last two years have been. In 2020, the full impact of the pandemic started to be felt from the first quarter -- end of the first quarter. Whilst demand started to improve through 2021, we then started to see the impacts of commodity and freight inflation as well as significant supply chain pressures build through the year. This makes our normal quarterly phasing more difficult to model as there are fundamental changes in the underlying comparatives that make historic norms less relevant. Let me explain. In 2021, pricing was slow to ramp up and picked up at the third and fourth quarters of the year following midyear and October price increases. From a cost perspective, material and freight costs were about flat in the first quarter and then ramped up through to be at their highest in absolute terms in the fourth quarter. So, that sets up our comparisons. Then this year, we will begin this year with a carryover pricing from midyear and October 2021. And then we expect to have additional pricing in 2022. That\u2019s why we expect pricing to be more or less evenly spread across the quarters as we move through 2022. Then we will lap those rising material and freight costs and manufacturing inefficiencies as we move towards the back half of the year, so we will have easier comparisons. In a nutshell, we anticipate the greatest headwinds to margin in 2022 to occur in the first quarter. This is completely counter to the normal historic pattern of strong margins in the first quarter, with margins decreasing sequentially to the fourth. We expect those headwinds to margins to abate as the year goes on, as we realize more price and as we lap the higher costs. More importantly, we intend price increases to more than offset manufacturing cost increases in, ['Andrew Bonfield', 'Jim Umpleby', 'Operator', 'Jennifer Driscoll']\n6, JPM, 4, 2021, 2022-01-14 13:48:03, Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase\u2019 Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your lines will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please standby. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead. Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. It\u2019s slightly longer this quarter to cover both our fourth quarter and full year results, as well as spend some time talking about the outlook for next year. Starting with the fourth quarter on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $10.4 billion, EPS of $3.33 on revenue of $30.3 billion, and delivered an ROTCE of 19%. These results included a $1.8 billion net credit reserve release, which I\u2019ll cover in more detail shortly. Adjusting for this, we delivered a 17% ROTCE this quarter. Touching on a few highlights, as we suggested last quarter, we have started to see a", "doc_id": "7936ccf9-a4b0-4193-b606-bce795a6fe3e", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "fc71181997d623527046231b7756da41811974a08d14b3504927b13e02b35b31", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 196966, "end": 201046, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "1b561725-ec59-48aa-ac54-8b237b462380", "3": "87a58f43-e87e-4d62-b293-719757b91803"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "87a58f43-e87e-4d62-b293-719757b91803": {"__data__": {"text": "on a few highlights, as we suggested last quarter, we have started to see a pickup in loan growth, 8% year-on-year and 3% quarter-on-quarter ex-PPP, with a significant portion of this growth coming from AWM and Markets. But we\u2019re also seeing positive indicators in card, as well as increasing revolver utilization and C&I. And it was an exceptionally strong quarter for Investment Banking, particularly M&A, as well as another good quarter in AWM. On page 2, we have some more detail on the fourth quarter. Revenue of $30.3 billion was up 1% year-on-year. Net interest income was up 3%, primarily driven by balance sheet growth, partially offset by lower CIB Markets NII, and NIR was down 1%, largely driven by normalization in CIB Markets and lower production revenue in home lending, mostly offset by higher IB fees on strong advisory. You\u2019ll notice that we\u2019ve added some memo lines to this page this quarter to show NII and NIR excluding Markets, as well as the third line of standalone Markets total revenue, which as we said before, is more consistent with the way we run the Company. We\u2019ll be keeping this format going forward and you\u2019ll see later that this is how we will talk about the outlook. If you look at things on this basis, the drivers are the same, but the numbers are a little different. NII excluding Markets is up 4%, NIR excluding Markets is up 3%, and Markets is down 11% on normalization. Expenses of $17.9 billion were up $1.8 billion or 11%, largely on higher compensation and credit costs were a net benefit of $1.3 billion, reflecting reserve releases. Looking at the full year results on page 3, the Firm reported net income of $48.3 billion, EPS of $15.36, and record revenue of $125.3 billion. We delivered a return on tangible common equity of 23% or 18%, excluding the reserve releases. And then, onto reserves on page 4. We released $1.8 billion this quarter, reflecting a more balanced outlook due to the continued resilience in the macroeconomic environment. Our outlook remains constructive, but our reserve balances still account for various sources of uncertainty and potential downside as a result of the remaining abnormal features of the economic environment. On the balance sheet and capital on page 5, we ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13%, up slightly, and reflecting nearly $5 billion of capital distributions to shareholders, including $1.9 billion of net repurchases. With that, let\u2019s go to our businesses, starting with consumer and community banking on page 6. CCB reported net income of $4.2 billion, including reserves releases of $1.6 billion. Revenue of $12.3 billion was down 4% year-on-year and reflects lower production margins in home lending and higher acquisition costs in card, partially offset by higher asset management fees in consumer and business banking. Many of the key balance sheet drivers are in line with the prior quarter. Deposits were up 20% year-on-year and 4%, sequentially, and client investment assets were up 22% year-on-year, about evenly split between market performance and flows. Combined credit and debit spend was up 27% versus the fourth quarter of \u201819 with each quarter in 2021 showing sequential growth compared to 2019. Within that, travel and entertainment spend was up 13% versus 4Q \u201819, but we have seen some softening in recent weeks contemporaneously with the Omicron wave. Card outstandings were up 5% year-on-year, but remain down 8% versus 4Q \u201819. However, it\u2019s promising to see that while revolving balances bottomed in May of 2021, since then, they\u2019ve kept pace with 2019 growth rates. In home lending, loans were down 1% year-on-year but up 1% quarter-on-quarter as prepayments have slowed. And it was another strong quarter for originations, totaling $42.2 billion, up 30% year-on-year. In fact, it was the highest fourth quarter since 2012, driven by increase in both purchase and refi volumes.

In auto, average loans were up 7% year-on-year and up 1% quarter-on-quarter. After several strong quarters, the lack of vehicle supply resulted in a decline in originations to $8.5 billion, down 23% year-on-year. So overall, loans ex-PPP, were up 2% year-on-year and sequentially, driven by card and auto, and expenses of $7.8 billion were up 10% year-on-year on higher compensation, as well as continued investments in technology and marketing. Next, the CIB on page 7. CIB reported net income of $4.8 billion on revenue of $11.5 billion for the fourth quarter. And for the full year, net income was $21 billion on record revenue of $52 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $3.2 billion was up 28% versus the prior year and up 6% sequentially. IB fees were up 37% year-on-year, primarily driven by a strong performance in advisory. And we maintained our number one rank with a full year wallet share of 9.5%. In advisory, we were up 86% and it was the third consecutive all time record quarter, benefiting from elevated M&A volumes that continued throughout 2021, specifically for midsized deals. Debt underwriting fees were up 14%, driven by an active leverage loan market, primarily linked to acquisition financing. And in equity underwriting, fees were up 12%, primarily driven by our strong performance in IPOs. Moving to Markets, total revenue was $5.3 billion, down 11% against a record fourth quarter last year. Compared to 2019, we were up 7% driven by a strong performance in equities. Fixed income was down 16% year-on-year reflecting a more difficult trading environment early in the quarter, especially in rates, as well as continued normalization from the favorable trading performance last year in currencies, emerging markets, credit and commodities. Equity markets were down 2% on $2 billion of revenue, as continued strength in Prime was more than offset by modest weakness in derivatives. For the full year, equities revenue was $10.5 billion, up 22% at an all time record. It was a particularly strong year for both Investment Banking and Markets. And looking ahead, we do expect some modest normalization of the wallet in 2022. However, for purposes of the first quarter in Investment Banking, the overall pipeline remains quite robust. Payments revenue was $1.8 billion, up 26% year-on-year or up 7% excluding net gains on equity investments. And the year-on-year growth was from higher fees and deposits, largely offset by deposit margin compression. Security services revenue of $1.1 billion was flat year-on-year. Expenses of $5.8 billion were up 18% year-on-year, predominantly due to higher compensation as well as volume related and legal expenses. And credit costs were not benefit of $126 million, driven by the reserve release, I mentioned upfront. Moving to Commercial Banking on page 8. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.3 billion and an ROE of 20%. Revenue of $2.6 billion was up 6% year-on-year on record Investment Banking revenue, driven by continued strength in M&A and acquisition related financing. Expenses of $1.1 billion were up 11% year-on-year, largely due to investments and higher volume and revenue related expenses. Deposits were up 8% sequentially on seasonality. Loans were down 1% year-on-year and up 2% sequentially, excluding PPP. C&I loans were up 4% ex-PPP, primarily driven by higher revolver utilization and originations in middle markets and increased short-term financing and corporate client banking. CRE loans were up 1% with higher new loan originations, offset by net payoff activity. And credit costs were a net benefit of $89 million, driven by reserve releases with net charge-offs of 2 basis points. And then, to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 9. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.1 billion with a pretax margin of 34%. Revenue of $4.5 billion was up 16%", "doc_id": "116846cb-b70a-464e-a3f1-94f578bbabfe", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "5404cb8ca5e96e4c5dea58873667c5b0d84c5cd74ee2e9fc5181063c030ed5b1", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 204980, "end": 208890, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "87a58f43-e87e-4d62-b293-719757b91803", "3": "49a53c5c-d1b1-4c99-88ea-d1d12d3c32d0"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "49a53c5c-d1b1-4c99-88ea-d1d12d3c32d0": {"__data__": {"text": "with a pretax margin of 34%. Revenue of $4.5 billion was up 16% year-on-year, as higher management fees and growth in deposits and loans were partially offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $3 billion were up 9% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher performance related compensation and distribution fees. For the quarter, net long-term term inflows were $34 billion and for the full year were positive across all channels, asset classes and regions, totaling a record of $164 billion. AUM of $3.1 trillion and overall client assets of $4.3 trillion, up 15% and 18% year-on-year, respectively, were driven by strong net inflows and higher market levels. And finally, loans were up 4% quarter-on-quarter with continued strength in custom lending, mortgages and securities-based lending while deposits were up 15% sequentially. Turning to corporate on page 10. Corporate reported a net loss of $1.1 billion. Revenue was a loss of $545 million, down $296 million year-on-year. NII was up $160 million, primarily on higher rates, mostly offset by continued deposit growth. And NIR was down $456 million, primarily due to lower net gains on legacy equity investments. Expenses of $251 million were down $110 million year-on-year. So with that, as we close the books on 2021, we think it\u2019s important to take a step back and look at the performance over the last few years through the volatility of the COVID period, and then pivot to discussing the 2022 and medium-term outlook. So, turning to page 11, what stands out is the stability of both revenues and returns through a very volatile period, especially when you strip out the reserve builds and subsequent releases in 2020 and 2021. If you look at the revenue drivers on the bottom left-hand side of the page, you see overall revenue growth with some significant diversification benefits. NII, ex-Markets, was down nearly 20% on the headwinds of lower rates and card revolve that we\u2019ve discussed throughout the year. This was partially offset by significant NIR growth ex-Markets, largely from higher IB fees and AWM management and performance fees. And we also saw strength across products and regions in CIB Markets, as the extraordinary market environment in 2020 did not normalize as much as we expected in 2021. So, when you look across the Company, we saw consistent modest revenue growth, as well as good performance in the areas that we control, notably, staying in front of our clients to serve them well and managing our risks effectively, resulting in quite stable returns, once again proving the power of the JPMorgan Chase platform. So, turning to the next page. The strong revenue performance and consistent returns have further bolstered our confidence in forging ahead with an investment strategy designed to ensure that we\u2019re prepared for the long-term. On the left hand side of the page, you can see the expense drivers from 2019 to 2021. The first bar is structural. And while the growth of 2% is modest over the two-year period, that includes some COVID-related effects that we would see as temporary including, for example, lower T&E spend and elevated employee attrition. And we do expect some catch-up in those effects as we look forward. Then, the middle bar is $3.4 billion of growth in volume and revenue-related expenses. Some significant portion of that is driven by increases in incentive compensation, primarily from Investment Banking, Markets and Asset & Wealth Management, the major areas where we have seen exceptionally strong results and where changes in compensation are more closely linked to changes in performance. And remember, we\u2019ve seen a lot of market appreciation and strong flows in AWM and CCB. So, don\u2019t assume all of this is CIB as you look forward because there are some versions of the world where the markets in fee wallet goes one way and AUM goes the opposite way. And then, this bar also includes volume-related non-comp expenses such as brokerage and distribution fees, some of which are true expenses and some of which are bottom line neutral because they\u2019re offset with revenue", "doc_id": "49a53c5c-d1b1-4c99-88ea-d1d12d3c32d0", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "59817c385ba6d65afdd37fb16a3efa7a5893fa429e91dde52e9b7c68ca980bf7", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 208902, "end": 213005, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "116846cb-b70a-464e-a3f1-94f578bbabfe", "3": "0fb7b857-d773-49ef-a7c5-d4377e0d2058"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "0fb7b857-d773-49ef-a7c5-d4377e0d2058": {"__data__": {"text": "true expenses and some of which are bottom line neutral because they\u2019re offset with revenue gross-ups. Then, the last bar of $1.7 billion, as previewed with you this time last year, is a result of our investment agenda, which we\u2019ve been executing largely according to our plans and consistent with our longstanding priorities. You can see the breakdown of the total investment spend on the right hand side of the page, $9.6 billion growing to $11.3 billion across the categories that we\u2019ve often discussed. We\u2019re continuing to broaden our footprint and expand our distribution network. Then marketing, where the significant increase in spend as part of the reopening in the second half of last year resulted in a full year spend comparable to 2019. And tech, which we\u2019ve broadened to include tech adjacent spend, reflecting our recognition, the tech means more than just software development and encompasses data and analytics, AI as well as the physical aspects of modernization such as data centers. And what\u2019s really powerful to note here is our ability to make these investments, which are quite significant in dollar terms and are designed to secure our future while still delivering excellent current returns. So, over the next few pages, let\u2019s double click into some of these investment areas to see what we\u2019re doing, starting with examples of marketing and distribution on page 13. We\u2019ve expanded our reach across the U.S. and are thrilled to be the first bank in all contiguous 48 states, an important milestone in our branch market expansion plans. We also continue to expand internationally, including 13 international markets as part of our Commercial Bank expansion, China in both our CIB and AWM businesses, and in the UK with Chase UK, where we\u2019ve seen exciting progress since we launched in September, although we expect this to be a multiyear journey before having a measurable impact on the firm overall. We continue to hire bankers and advisors in investment banking, private banking and wealth management, really across all of the wholesale and consumer footprint where we believe we have opportunities to better penetrate geographies and sectors to continue to grow share. And as I just said, the point of our investment strategy is to secure the future of the Company. So, we\u2019re not making short-term claims about share outcome causality. But as you can see at the bottom of the page, our market shares are robust and growing broadly across the Company. Turning to page 14. In addition to all of our distribution-related investments, a critical foundational component of our strategy is technology where we spend over $12 billion annually with about half of that being investments or as we sometimes call it, change the bank spend. It\u2019s important to understand what\u2019s in the investment category. About half of that is foundational and mandatory, which includes regulatory-related investments, modernization and the retirement of technical debt in addition to other key strategic initiatives to help us face the future. On the left hand side, you can see some more detail around this. Modernization, which includes migrations to the cloud as well as upgrading legacy infrastructure and architecture, data strategy that enables us to extract the value that exists in our proprietary data set by cleaning it and staging it in the right ways and then deploying modern techniques against it, attracting and acquiring top talent with modern skills, and a product operating model, which is obviously a popular buzzword these days. But if you look through all that, it reflects the simple reality that the best products get delivered when developers and business owners are working together iteratively with end-to-end ownership. Underpinning all of this is our continued emphasis on cybersecurity to protect the Firm and our clients and customers as well as maintaining a sound control environment. Moving to the right hand side. The other half of the investment spend is to drive innovation across our businesses and with our client-facing products. We believe it\u2019s critical to identify and resolve customer pain points and improve the user experience. And we\u2019re attacking the problem with a combination of building, partnering and buying. And so, a few examples of that. On the retail side,", "doc_id": "0fb7b857-d773-49ef-a7c5-d4377e0d2058", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "d142cb7c378efec8eea6f33aa55c7f25288e0b4632f4f24d6aa9a302565fd58d", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 212980, "end": 217287, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "49a53c5c-d1b1-4c99-88ea-d1d12d3c32d0", "3": "70e05525-8ef4-4441-96f7-478e0ba04966"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "70e05525-8ef4-4441-96f7-478e0ba04966": {"__data__": {"text": "and buying. And so, a few examples of that. On the retail side, we\u2019ve been able to digitalize existing product offerings with applications like Chase MyHome and launch a cloud native digital bank with our recent Chase UK launch. On the wholesale side, we continue to innovate on our Execute trading platform, commercialized blockchain through Onyx and are building out real-time payments capabilities. In addition, our modernization allows us to more efficiently partner with or acquire more digitally centered companies. And you can see several examples of this on the page. So, taken together, our strategy and investments are critical to ensuring that we can compete with the most innovative players out there, whether we\u2019re the ones pushing the envelope of innovation or responding quickly to the creativity of our competitors but doing so at scale. With that, let\u2019s talk about the outlook and the year ahead, starting on page 15. As you\u2019ll remember from Daniel\u2019s comments in December, the 17% that we have talked about as a medium-term ROTCE target is not realistic for 2022. We do expect to see some tailwinds to NII, including the benefit of the latest implied and the expectation that card revolve rates will increase. But the headwinds likely exceed the tailwinds as capital markets normalize off an elevated wallet, and we continue to make additional investments as well as the impact of inflationary pressures. However, despite these potential challenges for the near-term outlook, we do continue to believe in 17% ROTCE as our central case for the medium term as rates continue to move higher and we realized business growth, driven by our investments. So, let us try to give you more detail around forward-looking drivers that could be headwinds or tailwinds. So first, the rate curve. Our central case does not require a return to a 2.5% Fed funds target rate as the current forward curve only prices in 625 basis-point hikes over the next three years. Assuming we realize the forward curve, from there, we see the outcomes as being relatively symmetric with plus or minus 175 basis points of ROTCE impact as a reasonable range relative to our central case. And of course, there are obviously any number of rate paths to get there, which could produce different outcomes over the near term. In this illustration, the downside assumes that rates stay relatively constant to current spot rates whereas upside would be driven by a combination of a steeper yield curve, more hikes together with a more favorable deposit reprice experience. And of course, what we are evaluating here is the impact of rates in isolation on NII, but for the performance of the Company as a whole, credit matters a lot. And the reason why rates are higher will have an impact on that. In markets and banking, we feel good about the share we\u2019ve taken, and there are reasons why the beginning of a rate hiking cycle could be quite healthy for fixed income revenues in particular, at least in the sense that it might provide a partial offset to what we would otherwise expect in terms of post-COVID revenue normalization. In our central case, markets and banking normalized somewhat in 2022 relative to their respective record years in 2020 and 2021, and resume modest growth thereafter. The downside case assumes a return to 2019 trend line levels with sub-GDP growth rates, whereas the upside case assumes continued growth from current elevated levels. As we\u2019ve been discussing in consumer, the big surprise as we emerge from the worst moment of the pandemic was the lower level of card revolve, even as spend has started to return. In our central case, we assume healthy sales growth from the back of continued economic recovery and strong account acquisitions. And that, combined with relatively constant revolve rates, generates a strong recovery in revolving balances. But there are those who worry about a permanent structural shift in consumer behavior, which could be a source of downside. And in that scenario, revolving balances could stay depressed relative to the long-term pre-pandemic averages, resulting in approximately 50 basis points of downside relative to our central case. Of course, there could be an upside case where revolving balances recover much", "doc_id": "70e05525-8ef4-4441-96f7-478e0ba04966", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "d19928b2a13e4c1926287199665156a4a3c569952171675b91eefc8dcfd066f2", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 217314, "end": 221574, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "0fb7b857-d773-49ef-a7c5-d4377e0d2058", "3": "36a67542-8d67-4a95-903c-b5a10045ca10"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "36a67542-8d67-4a95-903c-b5a10045ca10": {"__data__": {"text": "Of course, there could be an upside case where revolving balances recover much faster but we believe the risks here are more likely to be skewed to the downside. And then, let\u2019s touch on inflation for a second, which is obviously increasingly relevant. On balance, modest inflation that leads to higher rates is good for us. But under some scenarios, elevated inflationary pressures on expenses could more than offset the rates benefit, which could represent around 75 basis points of downside. And while it\u2019s not on the page, another key driver is capital, where even though we remain hopeful, our central case assumes no recalibration of the rules and that we will operate at a higher CET1, reflecting that we finished the year in the 4.5% GSIB bucket which equates to a 1% increase from GSIB in the central case. Although as a reminder, that does not become binding until 2024. This is a good opportunity to point out that QE deposit growth and growth of the overall financial system proxy by GDP growth of the factors in the original 2015 rule release combined represent two full GSIB buckets. So, in the absence of those, we would still be in the 3.5% bucket. With that in mind, any recalibration could be a tailwind. And each 1% change in the CET1 level is worth about 150 basis points of ROTCE. And to be clear, for simplicity, we\u2019ve assumed a normal credit environment in the analysis on the page. So, when we take a step back, 17% remains our central case in the medium term. But over the next one to two years, we expect to earn modestly below that target. In light of all that, let\u2019s talk about near-term guidance on page 16. We expect NII, excluding Markets, to be roughly $50 billion in 2022, up approximately $5.5 billion from 2021. As I mentioned upfront, this is a change relative to how we\u2019ve previously guided as we feel that the ups and downs of Markets\u2019 NII can be a distraction when the vast majority of that variation is likely to be bottom line neutral. Looking at the key drivers of that for 2022, there are a few major factors. Rates, with the market implied suggesting approximately three hikes later this year and the reason steepening of the yield curve, we would expect to see about $2.5 billion more NII from that effect. You can see at the bottom right, we\u2019ve shown you the third quarter earnings at risk and an estimate of what we would expect to disclose in the 10-K, reflecting the year-end rate curve and changes in the portfolio composition. And as we note in our quarterly filings, there are lots of reasons to be careful in trying to use EAR to predict NII changes under real-world conditions. But at a high level, if you look at the numbers on the bottom right and what\u2019s happening to the yield curve recently, you should find the $2.5 billion increase relatively intuitive. Then, balance sheet growth and mix, where we are expecting higher spend and new originations to drive revolving balances back to 2019 levels, and also benefiting from securities deployment towards the end of 2021 and into 2022. And partially offsetting both of those factors is the roll-off of PPP. So, while we do expect NII to increase year-on-year, depending on the path of rates, it may take a couple of years to return to the full NII generating capacity of the Company. Turning to page 17. As we said at the outset of this section, we are in for a couple of years of sub-target returns. Despite this, we are going to continue to invest and we\u2019re not going to let temporary headwinds distract us from critical strategic ambitions. And so, looking at adjusted expenses, we expect roughly $77 billion in 2022, an increase of about $6 billion year-on-year or 8%. And before we go into the breakdown, it\u2019s worth noting, while the year-on-year increase is eye-catching, a meaningful portion of it is actually the annualization of post reopening trends from the second half of 2021 across various categories. So starting with the first", "doc_id": "36a67542-8d67-4a95-903c-b5a10045ca10", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "43f8c53b4457836dc72f262a6a9436f96d1cbf781b75ac3a881e10c5b4f54559", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 221560, "end": 225508, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "70e05525-8ef4-4441-96f7-478e0ba04966", "3": "44981ab0-cc27-4e91-9436-aae84638127d"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "44981ab0-cc27-4e91-9436-aae84638127d": {"__data__": {"text": "from the second half of 2021 across various categories. So starting with the first bucket on the page, which is the structural expense increase. As I alluded to earlier, we are seeing some catch-up this year, both from the impact of inflation and our compensation expenses as well as higher non-comp expense with the resumption of T&E. Then, volume and revenue-related expenses. Remember that this is both comp and non-comp. From a comp perspective, to the extent we are assuming some normalization of capital markets revenues, there should be a tailwind here. But keep in mind a couple of points. The normalization assumption for Markets and IB fees at this point is pretty modest. And our assumption for AUM is for modest increases. At the same time, we have the impact of volume growth on non-comp, both in wholesale and in consumer, which is offset by lower auto lease depreciation. And most importantly, we are adding another $3.5 billion of investments, which I would note includes the run rate impact of our acquisitions as well as some of the run rate effects that I just mentioned and reflects similar themes to the ones I discussed earlier. As I wrap up, it\u2019s another good moment to stop and note how privileged we are to have the financial strength and the earnings generating capacity to absorb these inflationary pressures while also making critical investments to secure the future of the Company. So, in closing, on page 18, we\u2019re happy with what we\u2019ve been able to achieve over the last two years. Not only the business results, some of which are highlighted here on the page, but also continuing to serve our customers, clients and communities, and importantly, executing on our strategic priorities. As we look ahead, we will continue to invest and innovate to build and strengthen this franchise for the long term. And while there may be headwinds in the near term as we continue to work through the consequences of the pandemic, we\u2019ve never felt better about the Company and our position in this very competitive dynamic landscape. So, with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.  And our first question is coming from the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, my first question is for you, and it\u2019s on page 16. And it\u2019s a two-part question on this guidance. The first is, could you help us size the timing and magnitude of deposit beta that you presume in this $50 billion number as well as the size of securities deployment? And the second part to that question is, clearly, we\u2019re missing that white box, right, in terms of CIB markets contribution. And if you could give us sort of rails to think about CIB markets in light of your comments about more modest normalization versus the idea that this business is naturally liability sensitive? Right. Okay. So, three questions in there. Let me take them one at a time. So beta, at the end of the day, the reprice experience is going to be a function of the competitive environment. But for the purposes of working through the guidance, I can tell you that we\u2019re assuming that this hiking cycle is going to be generally similar to the prior hiking cycle, all else equal. The environment is a little bit different in some important respects. So, I think the system this time around is flushed with deposits, is flushed with liquidity in a way that it wasn\u2019t before. So, that could at the margin make the reprice a little bit slower. On the other hand, the competitive environment is different, especially with some of the neo bank entrants and that could go in the other direction. So, it will be what it will be. But for the purposes of the guidance, we\u2019re assuming a reprice experience that\u2019s similar to what we experienced in the prior cycle. In terms of deployment, obviously, deployment is going to be a situational decision. But, if you\u2019re looking at the $4 billion bar on page 16, securities deployment is a modest contributor to that $4 billion number. The bulk of it is the loan growth narrative, particularly in card.

But big picture, if you need something for your model or whatever, there\u2019s a couple of things we could suggest. So, if you look at the supplement, we\u2019ve actually been disclosing the Markets NII number for some time in the supplement. So, you actually have a pretty decent time series of that number over time. If you address that thing against the Fed funds rate, you\u2019ll actually see that there\u2019s a pretty clear negative correlation there. And so, you can draw some conclusions from that. But I just will point out that like in any given moment, relatively small changes to the mix of the Markets balance sheet can really change the NII quite significantly, even in an environment of no policy rate changes. So, it\u2019s sort of like a health warning against putting too much emphasis on that projection. Very clear. My second compound question is on capital. If you could give us an update -- I know that January 1st is the adoption for SA-CCR, if you could give us an estimate on the impact of CET1? And just to clarify, that 17% medium-term ROTCE does take into account that your GSIB surcharge is 4.5%? Yes. So, let me do the second one first. So in short, yes. So, as I said in the script, we are not assuming any recalibration in that 17% target. So, that does mean 4.5% GSIB in the equity component of that number. In terms of SA-CCR, the impact of SA-CCR adoption was about $40 million of standardized RWA. So, I think if you do the math, that\u2019s like 10 basis points of CET1. Our next question is coming from John McDonald from Autonomous Research. Hey Jeremy, I want to follow up on that. Maybe a broader discussion on how you\u2019re managing the capital constraints, the SLR and the rising GSIB. And what does it mean for balancing share buybacks, which obviously reduced this quarter, preferred issuance and other levers that you have? Yes. So, as you know, John, in terms of share buybacks, that\u2019s at the bottom of our capital stack. So, to the extent that we\u2019re seeing robust loan growth, other opportunities to invest in the business as well as potential M&A opportunities, those are all going to come ahead of buybacks. And so, I don\u2019t want to sort of guide on our buyback plans for next year, which under SCB, as you know, are really quite flexible as a function of the earnings generation outcomes, the capital build. But you can kind of draw your own conclusions in terms of the growth and the minimums that we see in the future as well as the loan growth as well as some of the investments that we\u2019re making. And frankly, we\u2019re kind of happy about that. That\u2019s just -- we want the capital to be used that way rather than being used for buybacks. Okay. And then, as the follow-up, maybe compound follow-up. The new CET1 target or where you expect to kind of run this year, if you could clarify that. And also, any color on the modest normalization of the FICC and equities wallets that you could flush out? Yes. So, in terms of the target, I mean, I said previously that 12% was not off the table. And that remains true. Depending on the outcome of the rule side, depending on the Basel III endgame, depending on all the various components, you can see a world where 12% remains the, ['Jeremy Barnum', 'Erika Najarian', 'John McDonald', 'Operator']\n7, CVX, 4, 2021, 2022-01-28 13:46:04, Good morning.

After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. . As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.  I will now turn the conference call over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Roderick Green. Please go ahead. Thank you, Jen. Welcome to Chevron's fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call and webcast. I'm Roderick Green, GM of Investor Relations. Our Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth; and CFO, Pierre Breber, are on the call with me. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron's website. Before we begin, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Now I will turn it over to Mike. Thanks, Roderick. After the challenges of 2020, we began last year clear eyed about the economic realities we faced, and at the same time, optimistic about an eventual recovery. By the end of 2021, we had one of our most successful years ever, with return on capital employed approaching 10%, our highest since 2014; the successful integration of Noble Energy, while more than doubling initial synergy estimates; and record free cash flow, 25% greater than our previous high. 2021 was also the year when Chevron accelerated our efforts to advance a lower-carbon future by forming Chevron New Energies, an organization that aims to grow businesses in hydrogen, carbon capture and offsets, introducing a 2050 net-zero aspiration for upstream Scope 1 and 2 emissions and establishing a portfolio carbon intensity target that includes Scope 3 emissions and more than tripling our planned lower carbon investments. Chevron is an even better company today than we were just a few years ago. We're showing it through our actions and our performance, which we expect to drive higher returns and lower carbon. And we intend to keep getting better. Our record free cash flow enabled us to strongly address all 4 of our financial priorities in 2021, a higher dividend for the 34th consecutive year, a disciplined capital program, well below budget, significant debt paydown with a year-end net debt ratio comfortably below 20% and another year of share buybacks, our 14th out of the past 18 years. I expect 2022 will be even better for cash returns to shareholders with another dividend increase announced this week and first quarter buybacks projected at the top of our guidance range. We're optimistic about the future, focused on continuing to reward our shareholders while investing to grow our businesses and maintaining a strong balance sheet. We made the most of this challenging period, transforming Chevron through a well-timed acquisition and an enterprise-wide restructuring into a leaner and more productive company. In just 2 years, CapEx was reduced by almost half from Chevron and Noble's pre-COVID total. And operating expenses for the combined company in 2021 were lower than for Chevron on a standalone basis in 2019. The Noble acquisition and increasing capital efficiency enabled us to maintain a 5-year reserve replacement ratio above 100%. And 2021 was very consistent with that longer-term performance, driven primarily by additions in the Permian, Gulf of Mexico and Australia and partly offset by lower reserves in Kazakhstan, mostly due to higher prices and their negative effect on our share of reserves. For more on our strong financial performance, over to Pierre. Thanks, Mike. We reported fourth quarter earnings of $5.1 billion or $2.63 per share. Adjusted earnings were $4.9 billion or $2.56 per share. The quarter's results included 3 special items: asset sale gains of $520 million, primarily on sales of mature conventional assets in the U.S.; losses on the early retirement of debt of $260 million, which will result in significant future interest cost savings; and pension settlement costs of $82 million. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of this presentation. Full year earnings were over $15 billion, the highest since 2014. Compared with 3Q, adjusted 4Q earnings were down $770 million.

Adjusted upstream earnings were flat, with higher realizations offset primarily by negative LNG trading timing effects and higher DD&A. DD&A increased on catch-up depreciation for our interest in North West Shelf, which no longer meets asset held-for-sale criteria and impairments of certain late life assets triggered by updated abandonment estimates. Other items include additional taxes and royalties related to higher prices under certain international contracts. Adjusted downstream earnings were down with lower chemicals margins and volumes at CPChem and GS Caltex in addition to year-end inventory charges. The All Other segment declined due to tax charges. Across all segments, operating expenses increased in part due to higher accruals for employee bonuses and stock-based compensation. Adjusted earnings increased over $15 billion compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased realizations in upstream as well as improved refining and chemicals margins. Costs were up primarily on the acquisition of Noble Energy that closed in 4Q 2020, higher fuel costs and an unfavorable swing in accruals for employee benefits. 2022 production is expected to be flat to down 3% due to expiration of contracts in Indonesia and Thailand. These contracts are not being extended as we were unable to do so in terms competitive with our alternatives. Excluding contract expirations and 2022 asset sales, we expect a 2% to 5% increase in production led by the Permian and lower turnaround activity in TCO in Australia. We reaffirm our prior long-term guidance of a 3% production CAGR through 2025, and we'll share more about our long-term outlook at our upcoming Investor Day. I'll call out a few items on Slide 11. Full year guidance for the All Other segment excludes special items such as pension settlement costs. The All Other segment can vary quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. Affiliate dividends are expected to be between $2 billion and $3 billion, depending primarily on commodity prices and margins. We do not expect any additional lending or loan repayments this year at TCO. Finally, asset sale proceeds are expected to be in line with historical averages. We've updated our price sensitivities to include natural gas. Also, our guidance for both earnings and cash flow sensitivities is now the same as we're likely to consume the remainder of our NOLs and other favorable tax attributes if prices remain higher. Finally, we did not receive our federal income tax refund last quarter and expect it later this year. Back to Mike. All right. Thanks, Pierre. I believe 2021 was a pivotal year for Chevron, where we got better in so many ways. And we look forward to 2022 and beyond, confident in our strategy and capabilities that aim to deliver higher returns and lower carbon. We'll share more during our Investor Day on March 1. At this time, we expect to be at the New York Stock Exchange with a limited number of participants. The meeting will be webcast for all to see. With that, I'll turn it back to Roderick. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions. Please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We will do our best to get all questions answered. Jen, please open the line. . Our first question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. The first question I had was more of a housekeeping item for you, Pierre, which is, in the quarter, it looked like LNG timing effects had a meaningful drag here. I recognize there was a lot of volatility, particularly towards the end of the month with TPS and JKM, but maybe you can break it down in layman's terms for us. What does that really mean and what happened in the quarter? Thanks, Neil. About half of the timing effects in the quarter and first, we're showing a swing between 3Q and 4Q. We had a gain in the third quarter and a negative variance -- a negative absolute amount and a negative swing in fourth quarter. About half of the effects in the quarter were due to a negative inventory charge. So we had 2 cargoes on the water at", "doc_id": "2d2f0084-9493-422e-bc29-04188f0afcf7", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "4d4b1c594be5333d7cd17dafbd577fc583347f5300b8ffdcc5082225d6c4fca2", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 237698, "end": 241820, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "872962ad-d47b-4295-bf15-d1b46906668b", "3": "70c2f2d9-cd19-4853-8cfe-6d34adf63336"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "70c2f2d9-cd19-4853-8cfe-6d34adf63336": {"__data__": {"text": "quarter were due to a negative inventory charge. So we had 2 cargoes on the water at year-end. They get valued into inventory at average annual prices, which were well below the purchase price because as you said, Neil, prices -- this was a rising price environment and prices rose in the end of the quarter. So that will reverse itself next year when those are -- or this year when they're sold at the higher prices that they purchased at. And then the balance of the timing effects are in paper mark-to-market effects. And as you know, the fit the paper, which is tied to physical cargoes gets marked to market where the physical cargoes are not. And so that creates a timing effect, which unwinds when the physical cargoes are delivered. We ended the year with a positive mark-to-market, but not as positive as what we had at the end of the third quarter. We added some JKM shorts during the quarter to balance our portfolio. We're still net long JKM. So any effects going forward will depend on the direction of future prices. And all this activity is really just geared towards managing our overall price exposure between our sales agreements and our supplies, which are a mix of both Brent and JKM prices. And just to put a fine point on the comment you made, these positions are not very large. But when we have natural gas LNG price movements that have gone from $10 to $20 to $30 an Mcf, it's causing larger timing effects than you would normally see. That makes a lot of sense, Pierre. And then the follow-up for you is just on cash flow. Again, relative to consensus, it was softer. It does seem like there's some onetimers in there, maybe something around the timing of tax refunds and then where Angola shows up, but there's still a gap in there. So can you just talk about how you bridge to Street numbers in your mind, anything we need to carry forward as we think about next year? Well, I'll cover the 2 points you made. We -- and I mentioned that we did not receive the IRS tax refund that we expected in the fourth quarter, we expect it sometime this year. We did receive a TCO dividend. There is a 15% withholding tax that comes off of the dividend. And we did receive the Angola LNG return of capital. It actually exceeded our guidance. By the way, the TCO dividend was at the high end of our guidance range. And the return of capital from Angola was above our guidance. But again, it shows up in cash from investing and not cash from ops because it's a return of capital. If you look beyond that, we do have, and as I referred to in our prepared remarks, we have certain contracts internationally that have additional taxes and royalties that kick in essentially when oil and LNG prices are higher, and we don't share specifics on our contracts. But as we talked about, we had extraordinarily high LNG pricing of $30, and then we also had oil prices that increase during the year. And then the last thing I'd say is we provided guidance on the third quarter call on our expected increase in earnings from LNG spot cargoes. And we gave that guidance in part because LNG prices increased significantly. And we said we expected to have fewer cargoes because our long-term contract takes were going to be higher during the winter from our primarily Japanese customers. We did not operate -- we didn't produce as much out of Australia, so we had fewer LNG spot cargoes. And again, that was an opportunity missed and that resulted in lower earnings and cash flow. Neil, it's Mike. The one other thing you talked about what should you bear in mind going forward? As we've been in this fairly depressed commodity price environment, we've built up net operating losses in our business. And as we've returned to profitability, those have now been utilized and offset against taxes payable. As we work our way through those and in a strong price environment that could happen sooner rather than later, we'll be in a net taxable position that's quite different than what we were before as well. And so I think that's another point that may not be as evident in the quarter. But as you go forward, it's kind of a good news/bad news", "doc_id": "70c2f2d9-cd19-4853-8cfe-6d34adf63336", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "c94e956fa0494c014bd4f592e4293668e9e5606ff6b10d4b503ab5c9c82c6cf7", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 241822, "end": 245961, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "2d2f0084-9493-422e-bc29-04188f0afcf7", "3": "9b675a11-bf60-4d43-a7c5-19568d36c198"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "9b675a11-bf60-4d43-a7c5-19568d36c198": {"__data__": {"text": "in the quarter. But as you go forward, it's kind of a good news/bad news thing, I suppose, we're going to be more profitable, but it also means now we're going to have higher taxes payable. Our next question comes from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. My first question is on the 2022 production outlook. Obviously, you had an extremely strong Permian production in the fourth quarter. It's about 70,000 barrels a day -- or 80,000 barrels a day, I'm sorry, above the full year average, and you're guiding to 80,000 barrels a day of new production in '22 over '21. So it seems like you can just get there from the Permian alone. But I'm just curious, are there other moving pieces that you should be thinking about on the new production element of the growth for '22? Or is there some conservatism there? Any thoughts would be helpful. Yes, Phil, fourth quarter Permian does look strong. And one thing that we do see from time to time is with our non-operated joint venture position, sometimes the way production gets reported in by partners can result in a little bit of lumpiness in those numbers. But broadly speaking, the Permian is healthy and getting better. I think 2022 Permian production will be a little bit better than we showed at our Investor Day last March. And roughly speaking, up around maybe 10% compared to full year average in 2021. And that is the largest piece of what we would anticipate in terms of production growth next year. There is some growth in base and other primarily. As Pierre said in his comments, we've got lower planned turnaround activity at TCO, and we expect some more uptime at Gorgon. And then that's offset by a few asset sales that we would anticipate. So those are the significant moving pieces in production for 2022. Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And Mike, I know you'll get in a lot more detail in March at the Analyst Day and looking forward to that. But just kind of looking back pre-COVID at prior analyst days, your framework was 60 Brent that you're using to balance CapEx and distributions in a fairly evenly balanced framework. Obviously, oil is at 90 now and maybe you don't want to give a guidance at those types of levels. But I am curious how you're thinking about what is the right way to look at the cash balancing framework? What price would you think is reasonable these days? As I know you like to manage the business through the cycle, not based on spot prices. Yes. We will talk about that more in March, Phil. But our longer-term view on the pricing environment hasn't changed a lot. There's a lot of resource out there that can be produced economically at prices lower than what we see today. And our breakeven reflects that. And so we are in a period of time here where cash flow is strong. As we mentioned in our comments, the last 2 quarters have been the best 2 quarters the company has ever seen. And last year was 25% higher than the best year in our history. So we increased the dividend. Debt came down significantly, and we've guided to the high end of our share repurchase range. If we continue to see an environment like this, the balance sheet doesn't need to be a lot stronger than it is today. And we've already increased the dividend and we're going to be disciplined on capital. And so that really leaves one lever left. And I think over time, we're going to -- you should expect us to be consistent with our history, which is returning cash through share repurchases. And at least in an environment like this, we've got ample cash to do that and sustain that well into any kind of a correction that we eventually will see. Our next question comes from Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Our first question is on TCO. I guess now that you're through much of the winter campaign, is there any update on how FGP-WPMP and how those are tracking on cost and schedule maybe given your COVID protocols and efficiencies? And if you have any color on impact related to the recent geopolitical unrest, that would also be very helpful.Michael Wirth -  Sure, Jeanine. Fourth quarter was really good execution on field productivity. We made terrific progress and that's carried forward as we began the year. We did have some impact during the unrest that occurred in", "doc_id": "9b675a11-bf60-4d43-a7c5-19568d36c198", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "dd68ed876f5d44dd75e7dd6d6c2530b961e96c01df24032113943da4684595f9", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 245972, "end": 250199, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "70c2f2d9-cd19-4853-8cfe-6d34adf63336", "3": "7666ad2e-cb49-43ee-8e71-b21d69b10b56"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "7666ad2e-cb49-43ee-8e71-b21d69b10b56": {"__data__": {"text": "as we began the year. We did have some impact during the unrest that occurred in Kazakhstan, but for about a week is the amount of time that it really cost us in the field there. We've remobilized everyone now and are back at full strength in terms of field activity. And we've got a highly vaccinated workforce, more than 90%. One of the highest rates of vaccination anywhere in our system in the world. And while we have seen Omicron cases appear in the workforce there, at this point, it's at a level that's very well managed, and it's not having any impact on field construction and activity. So we are continuing to make good progress. We have not made any change to our cost or schedule guidance and are overall at about 89% project progress and 82% construction progress at this point. So things have been managed really well on the ground by our team during a pretty challenging month of January. Okay. Great. Good to hear. Our follow-up question or second question, maybe following up on Phil's question on the Permian. It's -- you guys had a really strong quarter, at least also compared to our expectations. You mentioned that 2022 production is a little better than where you thought it was going to be from your March Analyst Day forecast. So just can you clarify, have you accelerated activity there? Or is it really just all based on better efficiencies? And I guess given its importance to corporate growth in the medium term, are you taking any steps related to supplies or labor or equipment in anticipation of some tightening in the service markets over the next couple of years? Yes. So let me speak first to activity. And then I'm going to let Pierre, who's now in charge of our supply chain organization, by the way, speak to any signs of inflation and how we're managing that. Activity in the Permian is really increasing aligned with the guidance that we've issued previously and spending this year up from $2 billion to $3 billion. Wells put on production, a little bit over 200 we anticipate this year, which is up about 50% versus 2021. And we'll share an update on all of these things when we see you in March. So I would say this is really very well aligned with what we've already guided to and indicated and reflects the ongoing efficiencies that we continue to see in the field and just the quality of this asset, which endures as we go through cycles like the one we just went through. It's really quite nice to have an asset in your portfolio that is this large, that's this flexible when it comes to capital and that we can demobilize, remobilize, not that we would intend to do this frequently, but when conditions call for it, we've been able to exercise that flexibility here over the last couple of years. So strong progress there. And I'll let Pierre comment on input costs. Jeanine, we continue to manage our costs, we think, very well in the Permian and across our portfolio. Our capital budget, which we announced in December, expected some COGS increase, modest in the low single digits. And what we might be seeing a little bit more than that in the Permian, it's very manageable and we think we can offset it with efficiencies. So as we've talked about, although rates are up, they're still below where they were pre-COVID on rigs capacity in the industry for specific oil and gas, equipment and services is still below pre-COVID levels. So whereas we are exposed to labor and steel and certain other elements, cost elements that are tied to the broad-based economy, oil and gas-specific equipment services are still well under control and our ability to contract well, be a very good partner to work with, all gives us confidence that the little bit of cost pressure we're seeing is very manageable within the range of what we expected, and we intend to deliver our capital program in line with our budget. Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America. So Pierre, I think your explanation about the dividend from TCO being a return of capital, I think that probably explains why The Street's cash flow numbers were too high. But my question is really about the go-forward portfolio leverage. So you obviously lose Indonesia, you lose Thailand, which I guess was gas. But you've got the Permian driving growth on a lighter recent history of", "doc_id": "7666ad2e-cb49-43ee-8e71-b21d69b10b56", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "92dba542a49661ceba38d7a1ed191300a4814804764fc45d2e947a40aed2559b", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 250193, "end": 254497, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "9b675a11-bf60-4d43-a7c5-19568d36c198", "3": "56bae026-8aec-462c-ad98-b750ec7efca2"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "56bae026-8aec-462c-ad98-b750ec7efca2": {"__data__": {"text": "was gas. But you've got the Permian driving growth on a lighter recent history of PSC capital for the cost call standpoint. So my question is when I think about portfolio oil leverage for the go-forward outlook, how does that compare to the legacy portfolio given all those changes? Our guidance on -- let me start by saying we've always been the most levered among the integrated energy companies. That's a function of the portfolio we've created over a long time, which tends to be upstream-weighted. And within upstream, we tend to be oil-weighted. And again, a big portion of our LNG is sold under oil prices. So whereas we were viewed as a defensive stock during some of the challenging times in 2020 and last year because of how we manage the balance sheet and how we're able to flex our capital program and manage our costs, we really are more of an oil play and we're much more levered on the upside. And we've shown that in last Investor Day, and we'll show that again in the upcoming Investor Day. In terms of our sensitivity, I mean, it's still around the same when you factor it all in. I mean, Indonesia was working its way to be a fairly modest portion of the portfolio. You are right over time with both Tengiz and the Permian that increases are weighting in some ways. But the guidance that we provided of $400 million of earnings and cash flow benefit from a dollar change in prices still holds. My follow-up, if I may, is to go back to your one-off comments, the DD&A and the -- I guess, the timing effects. I'm just going to ask that the question for a little clarity. On the DD&A, it looks like there was some catch-up. What is -- how much was that because you didn't strip it out? I'm curious why you didn't strip it out. And then just real quick on the LNG, was there a shift in contract versus spot volume exposure that also impacted the quarter? And then that's it for me. Yes, Doug. And first, just on your first question, so the return of capital was Angola LNG. TCO was a dividend withholding tax. But you're right, that part of that does not show up in cash from ops. In terms of DD&A, about half is due to the catch-up at North West Shelf. So we designated that asset as held for sale about 18 months ago. So you're capturing 18 months of depreciation all in the fourth quarter. We don't call the special item because obviously, it would have been in our underlying results if we -- it had been held for use during that time. And the other half are impairments that are tied to increases in abandonment estimates for late in life assets. So because these estimates, which is part of our regular updating process because these assets are very late in life, they don't have the production -- remaining production life or time to recover those additional abandonment estimates and therefore, that results in an impairment. So about half is the catch up and the half -- and those are both, I would call them onetime in nature. And in terms of the LNG, yes, there was a shift in fourth quarter to more contractless spot. We guided to that on the third quarter. And as I mentioned earlier, it was even more so. So in the winter months, our Northern Hemisphere customers tend to increase their takes under the long-term contracts. And then we didn't produce as reliably in the fourth quarter, so we had fewer spot cargoes. So what you're seeing, we did not benefit as much with the run-up in spot prices as we had guided to in the third quarter, and our weighting was more oil contract-related. Now those contracts are doing very well. Spot market goes up and down. But you'll see more exposure as we go forward. Pierre, just I guess the point was the headline miss wasn't as bad as it looks. So thanks so much. Our next question comes from Devin McDermott from Morgan Stanley. So the first one I wanted to ask on is just CapEx. I think it's notable that you all came in for last year below the bottom end of your CapEx guide. And I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about some of the drivers of that CapEx beat. And then, Pierre, you mentioned before, I", "doc_id": "56bae026-8aec-462c-ad98-b750ec7efca2", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "4be4871cc64d41122039ec979d7af5e0fdf3b785d9ecda590b797d7bb91fe30b", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 254496, "end": 258593, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "7666ad2e-cb49-43ee-8e71-b21d69b10b56", "3": "413bf894-9866-4be9-8133-6f288760cd27"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "413bf894-9866-4be9-8133-6f288760cd27": {"__data__": {"text": "some of the drivers of that CapEx beat. And then, Pierre, you mentioned before, I think, that you're seeing or assumed a few percentage points of inflation in the Permian. I was wondering if you could just broaden that out and talk about the inflationary trends you're seeing across the global portfolio and opportunities to potentially offset that as you think about 2022 spending levels? So yes, sorry, the low single digits was really meant to be across the portfolio. And that's factored into our $15.3 billion capital program. But obviously, if you look offshore, those rig rates have stayed flat to down. And we do contract where we lock in rates for some services. We have price caps on some services. There's lots of ways that we work to mitigate our exposure to COGS. But -- so I would view it as low single-digits overall. Permian, perhaps a little bit higher, not nearly as high as numbers that I'm hearing from some others. We don't see anything in our cost that would be double digits at all. So a little bit very modest, presented to higher than what we had currently -- we had planned for and again, very manageable within -- by offsetting with efficiencies. And on 2021, Devin, there's nothing noteworthy in the profile of CapEx and what it was that drove the ultimate outcome, which was a little below what we had guided to. There's a lot of inertia in some of these things and as we pulled the hand break pretty hard in 2020, we throttled a lot of things down. And as we start to bottom out and turn that back around a little bit as we will in 2022, this system just needs to adjust to that. And so I wouldn't call it anything there that's unique or especially noteworthy. We have had, still, about half of the underspend is due to project deferrals like at Tengiz due to COVID and other impact and about half is capital -- greater capital efficiency and other cost savings. Okay. That's helpful. And then separately, I wanted to ask on Australia LNG and Gorgon specifically. I was wondering if you could talk in a bit more detail around some of the recent downtime there. What happened and then what steps are being taken to ensure better uptime here in 2022? Yes, I'll take that, Devin. Look, it's a point of frustration, no doubt. During normal rounds, we had an operator that spotted evidence that we had the risk of an operating issue at one of the units in the dehydration train. Nothing that was catastrophic or alarming but a sharp-eyed operator picked up evidence is something that as we investigated further, we felt it was prudent to take a quick pit stop to address this. And so that's been completed at 2 of the 3 trains, and they're all same design. So these things tend to show up across all 3 trains. . The third train is undergoing that pit stop right now and is also addressing a problem with one of the compressors that was identified, and this was an opportune time to make a couple of changes with that in order to reduce risk going forward. So we should -- we expect to operate reliably. We've done our first major turnaround on all 3 trains now, those are behind us at Gorgon. We do not have any planned turnarounds in 2022. And as we complete this last pit stop that's underway, our expectation is that we're going to have strong operational performance this year and see more production out of Gorgon than we did in '21. Our next question comes from Paul Sankey from Sankey Research. Guys, on your guidance, the volumes will fall this year, would you characterize that as you\u2019re using a conservative oil price assumption and being determined not to raise CapEx? Or were there other issues around the concessions, particularly? And as a follow-up, could you accelerate the Permian, if you wanted to? Or can you talk about inflationary pressures that you might be seeing in the Permian as a matter of labor, steel, et cetera, et cetera? Okay. Yes, on production guidance, Paul, I would hope this isn't big news to people. I mean it's -- we've long been public about the fact that we couldn't extend the concessions in Indonesia and Thailand on terms that", "doc_id": "413bf894-9866-4be9-8133-6f288760cd27", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "5ed230af195b34b454a040a3dbdf19702842fd98f5cf9b6dc80b3b77c413dd1b", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 258594, "end": 262689, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "56bae026-8aec-462c-ad98-b750ec7efca2", "3": "8496a438-e3a1-4e45-87b9-a379c7005daf"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "8496a438-e3a1-4e45-87b9-a379c7005daf": {"__data__": {"text": "we couldn't extend the concessions in Indonesia and Thailand on terms that would compete with other opportunities within our portfolio. And so this has been out in the public domain for quite some time. And so when you pull those out, we're at 2% to 5% and Pierre reiterated the compound annual growth of 3% out through 2025. And so this is very consistent with the guidance and the messaging that we've been trying to communicate for quite some time. On the question of, could you accelerate the Permian? In theory, the answer to that 5 years ago was yes. The answer to that today is yes. We've been very focused on execution, efficiency and returns. And as I said, we laid out in March of last year a profile that showed strong production growth, long plateau, strong returns and capital efficiency. We'll update that again here in the new year, but at March. But this is an asset that just continues to look as good as we've portrayed it to you, and we're not going to get out ahead of ourselves chasing anything as we bring activity back up from $2 billion last year to $3 billion. That's a 50% increase in capital spend. I mentioned that we're going to see a 50% increase in wells put on production in '22 versus '21. That is a meaningful step up in activity, and we want to execute that well. And so I don't think we're going to be tempted by the price of the day to put that at risk by doing more. And I think Pierre already addressed inflation. I don't know, Pierre, if there's anything else you'd like to say on either of those topics. No. Thanks, Paul. Our next question comes from Manav Gupta from Credit Suisse. My quick question is your U.S. downstream results were down about $400 million quarter-over-quarter and we expected about $200 million of that to be chemicals headwind. But we also saw somewhere so what peers are doing is that refining was able to jump up and make up for it. In this case, it looks like both went down a little. And if you could help us understand what the maintenance in the refining system, what went on in U.S. refining because of which refining was also down quarter-over-quarter? Manav, the -- there were a number of items we referred to, including year-end inventory effects. But the higher employee benefit costs really crosses all segments that would include U.S. downstream. So we had a very strong year. We expect higher employee bonuses and we accrued for that. And our stock ran up in the fourth quarter, and it's continued actually in the first quarter. And we have to do accrual for stock-based compensation that's tied to both the absolute stock price movement and the relative stock price movement because of how some of our incentive programs work. So that's in the segment, and I think that helps explain part of your question. And a quick follow-up is you have a global footprint. Help us understand within your entire system, how you're tracking refined product demand, gasoline, diesel, jet as well, anything you could help us understand where we are versus before the pandemic started. Yes. Manav, it's -- I think a lot of the data you see in the public domain is pretty good. We've got gasoline demand globally up higher than it was pre pandemic. Diesel at and perhaps slightly above, jet fuel continues to lag.

Mr. Leveridge, you may now begin. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I\u2019m here with James Quincey, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Murphy, our Chief Financial Officer. Note that we posted schedules under Financial Information in the Investors section of our company website at www.coca-colacompany.com. These schedules reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to by our senior executives during this morning\u2019s discussion to our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. You can also find schedules in the same section of our website that provide an analysis of our gross and operating margins. In addition, this call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives, which should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the Company\u2019s periodic SEC reports. Following prepared remarks this morning, we\u2019ll turn the call over for questions. Please limit yourself to one question. If you have more than one, please ask your most pressing one first and then reenter the queue. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to James. Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I\u2019d like to reflect on the past year and how we\u2019ve emerged stronger from the pandemic, including positive performance in the fourth quarter. I\u2019ll also highlight the broader macro environment and how we\u2019re executing in the marketplace. Finally, I\u2019ll touch briefly on the accelerators for growth that give us confidence we can achieve the 2022 guidance we\u2019ve provided today, with more on them to come at CAGNY next, this month. John will then discuss financial results for the quarter and our outlook in more detail. Before I get to it, I\u2019d like to acknowledge that our ability to emerge stronger would not have been possible without the efforts of our dedicated employees and system partners around the world, and I\u2019d like to thank them for their hard work, their contribution not only to our results, but to our curious, empowered inclusive and agile culture. In 2021, the operating environment remained dynamic as the pandemic continued to evolve, and factors like inflation and supply chain disruptions brought additional challenges. But over the year, our organization and system continued to manage through these circumstances with focus and flexibility. We are pleased with the results, which were above 2019 across key metrics, and we remain focused on building a stronger total beverage company. Now, looking more closely at our fourth quarter results. We saw another quarter of sequential improvement versus 2019, and we ended the year with volume ahead of 2019. Notably, it was the first quarter in which away-from-home volume was also ahead of 2019, while at-home channels remained strong. So, recapping the quarter four performance around the world, starting with Asia Pacific. China delivered strong performance in the quarter by capturing a growing trend among consumers of zero-calorie offerings, we doubled our Zero Sugar sparkling portfolio in terms of volume compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. We leveraged RGM strategies and targeting investments to gain share in e-commerce, thus driving growth for the overall business. In India, initiatives to build omnichannel presence and marketing campaigns around key occasions by leveraging festivals and passion points through occasion-led marketing and integrated execution drove a sequential increase in market share and nearly 30% growth in transactions for the quarter. Additionally, our local Thums Up brand became $1 billion brand in India, driven by focused marketing and execution plans. In Japan, while our system was faced with a very challenging year, we gained value share and consumers driven by successful innovation and commercial strategies.

In Q4, acceleration of vaccine efforts and strong results from the Fanta Colorful People and Sprite  campaigns helped drive our recovery. In EMEA, volume in Europe in the quarter surpassed 2019 despite mobility restrictions, particularly in Western Europe. Despite the recovery remaining asynchronous in the region, increased investments behind our brands in the marketplace resulted in our system driving the highest incremental retail value among FMCG players in the region. In Africa, volume continued to be ahead of 2019 in the fourth quarter, driven by our key markets with strong double-digit growth in Nigeria and Egypt. Additionally, increased investments behind our affordability and multi-serve packages drove value share for the full year above 2019 in the region. In Eurasia and Middle East, the top line continued to expand faster than the macro environment, driven by strong revenue growth management, execution and digital capabilities. Turkey, one of our key markets, grew 7 points of value share for the year in digital as total digital commerce expanded by close to 90%. In North America, despite COVID cases leading to business closings and some mobility restrictions, value share growth was strong in the quarter, driven by pricing, revenue growth management and strong execution in the market. The new Coca-Cola Zero Sugar continued to deliver strong results, outpacing category growth, while Sprite and smartwater grew drinker base and buy rates. Innovations also delivered strong performances, led by Coke with Coffee and Simply Almond. Latin America delivered another quarter of strong performance with mid-single-digit volume growth versus 2019. This resilience of the system has been driven by years of experience navigating volatile environments through strong and effective execution. Within Global Ventures, Costa continued to recover through the year but was impacted in Q4 due to COVID-related restrictions. Costa Express continued its strong performance in the UK, delivering results ahead of expectations. In China, the Costa ready-to-drink expansion continued its availability now in more than 300,000 outlets, continuing to drive a share position ahead of our key competitor. Finally, our Bottling Investments group continued to focus on productivity and transformation initiatives, delivering strong operating margin expansion for full year 2021. Due to improved mobility throughout the year, our industry is growing in both, volume and value. Gaining share was a key objective in our emerging stronger agenda. And this year, we gained value share in both, at-home and away-from-home channels. Our NARTD market share is above 2019 levels at a global level and in both at-home and away-from-home channels. We will continue to identify and address opportunities to further improve our value share, driven by data-backed insights. As we close the chapter on 2021, we emerged stronger by delivering both top line and EPS ahead of 2019, and we gained share in a growing industry. The actions we took during the pandemic have resulted in an agile and focused organization that is poised to capture the sizable opportunities that exist, and we continue to look to the future to build on our momentum and drive growth. As we turn to 2022, while it is impossible for us to know whether this variant will be the last, what is clear is that our consumers, our customers and our business are learning and adapting with great resilience. For example, while we have seen some impacts from the Omicron variant through the first few weeks of the year, we are not seeing the same level of disruption as previous waves, and our system is better equipped. Further recovery in 2022 will be determined by macro factors, including overall consumer sentiment as well as supply chain challenges; labor shortages; and of course, the inflationary pressures in interest rates. We are confident we are well equipped to navigate this environment and deliver on the guidance we provided today. Now, I\u2019ll touch on some of the capabilities we\u2019ve built to unlock the next stage of growth and will elaborate more at our virtual CAGNY presentation later this month.

The consumer continues to be at the center of our strategy. And through our total beverage company agenda, we are adapting to the macro and micro trends which are shaping consumer habits. We advanced our total beverage company agenda last year by streamlining our portfolio, focusing on the core and investing behind a portfolio of brands that allows us to meet the evolving needs of consumers. We completed much of this work on brand eliminations while being deliberate with brand transitions. This optimized portfolio will ensure we follow the consumer and win in emerging and fast-growing categories, and is complemented by the recent strategic acquisition of BODYARMOR as well as relationships like the new agreement with Constellation Brands, which will launch Fresca Mixed, and the extended relationship with Molson Coors, which will launch Simply Spiked Lemonade in the U.S. Our network marketing model, with global category teams and local operating units, is allowing us to focus on end-to-end consumer experiences that are data-driven and always on. Our announcement of WPP as our global marketing network partner is a foundational component of our new marketing model. This new agency approach gives us access to the best created lines, regardless of source, and is underpinned by leading-edge data and technology capabilities. The Real Magic campaign is the first campaign, which was cocreated internally, leveraging this new end-to-end approach, and the campaign is showing strong results with the consumers. We have good visibility into the benefits of the new marketing model. The approach will allow us to deliver best-in-class consumer-centric marketing experiences across our categories and around the world. We also built more discipline into our innovation process in 2021 with a key focus on scalable bets that can build momentum year-over-year. It\u2019s still early, but the approach is working. Revenue per launch and gross profit per launch were up 30% and 25%, respectively, versus prior year. And we took intelligent local experiments and move more rapidly to scale them across geographies. Sustainable packaging like refillables and labelless bottles, along with brands like Coke with Coffee, fairlife, AHA, Costa ready-to-drink and Lemon-Dou are all examples of local winners that have been extended to more markets. For 2022, our innovation process is increasingly supported by data, and our pipeline is robust with built-in agility and consists of big bets along with many shots on goal. The system has stepped up its RGM and execution capabilities, which is helping us navigate an inflationary environment, driving value growth in a segmented way. Due to the strength of our bottling partners and the stronger net alignment of the system, we are prepared to address opportunities as well as challenges may lie ahead. Our networked organizational structure is designed to better connect functions and operating units to help our system scale ideas faster. As we\u2019ve emerged stronger, we kept moving forward on integrating sustainability work into our business as it is a key driver of future growth. During the quarter, we were recognized for our commitment to transparency, an action to address environmental risks by earning an A score in CDP\u2019s assessment for water, an improvement over last year. We improved or maintained our score in CDP\u2019s assessments on other important areas like climate and forests. Additionally, to complement our World Without Waste goals, we announced a new global goal to reach 25% reusable packaging by 2030. Increasing refillable and reusable packaging options responds to consumer affordability and our sustainability aspirations, and it helps create a circular economy, and refillable packages have extremely high levels of collection and our low-carbon footprint beverage containers. Before I turn over to John, I want to say a big thank you and recognize our associates from both the Company and our bottling partners, who work with great dedication and unwavering commitment throughout another challenging year.

In the fourth quarter, we closed the year with strong results, despite the impact of the Omicron variant across many parts of the world. Our Q4 organic revenue growth was 9%. Our price/mix of 10% was driven by a combination of factors, including targeted pricing, revenue growth management initiatives as well as further improvement in away-from-home channels in many markets. Unit case growth showed further sequential improvement on a two-year basis and concentrate sales like unit cases by 10 points in the quarter, primarily due to six fewer days in the quarter. Despite commodity market inflation and the dynamic supply chain environment, comparable gross margin for the quarter was relatively flat versus prior year. Pricing initiatives and favorable channel and package mix were offset by the impact of consolidating the fast-growing finished goods, BODYARMOR business, along with incremental investments to sustain momentum in the overall business for 2022. We continued to invest in markets as they recovered and stepped up year-over-year marketing dollars again in Q4, spending in a targeted way to maximize returns. This increase in marketing investments, along with some top line pressure from six fewer days in the quarter, resulted in comparable operating margin compression of approximately 500 basis points for the quarter. For the full year, comparable operating margin was down approximately 100 basis points versus prior year as improved comparable gross margin was offset by the significant step-up in marketing. Importantly, versus 2019, a key measure we have focused on, comparable operating margin was up approximately 100 basis points. Putting it all together, fourth quarter comparable earnings per share of $0.45 was a decline of 5% year-over-year, resulting in full year comparable earnings per share of $2.32, an increase of 19% versus the prior year, as a strong resurgence in the business also benefited from a 3-point tailwind from currency and tax. We delivered strong free cash flow of $11.3 billion in 2021, with free cash flow conversion of approximately 115% and a dividend payout ratio well below our long-term target of 75%. With these results, we exceeded guidance on every metric for full year 2021. We have done tremendous work to emerge ahead of 2019 and set the stage to drive our growth agenda for years to come. We are spinning the strategy flywheels faster and more effectively. Our organization is focused on execution and enhancing our capabilities to fuel growth. As James mentioned, the pandemic will be one of the many factors, along with the dynamic macro backdrop that we face in the coming year. But our local businesses are ready to adapt and execute for growth. With that in mind, this morning, we provided guidance for 2022 that builds on momentum from 2021. We expect organic revenue growth of approximately 7% to 8%, and we expect comparable currency-neutral earnings per share growth of 8% to 10% versus 2021. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we anticipate an approximate 3-point currency headwind to comparable revenue and an approximate 3 to 4 points currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2022. Additionally, due to a certain change in recent regulations, we estimate an effective tax rate increase from 18.6% in 2021 to 20% for 2022, which is an estimated 2 percentage points headwind to EPS. Therefore, all-in, we expect comparable earnings per share growth of 5% to 6% versus 2021, including the combined 5- to 6-point headwind from currency and tax. We expect to generate approximately $10.5 billion of free cash flow of 2022 through approximately $12 billion in cash from operations, less approximately $1.5 billion in capital investments. This implies the fourth consecutive year of free cash flow conversion above our long-term range of 90% to 95%.", "doc_id": "1a171871-d12d-420a-964b-19cf2e46b115", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "7bd630ac21ea02235d6c44acb6603e9524db98594cd92bbe9fbce930d2e3e2eb", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 279673, "end": 283935, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "b104d15b-ab98-42f7-b918-7d85e7d1bf97", "3": "09bc5086-b8f5-4b79-b1cf-d5062de1d75c"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "09bc5086-b8f5-4b79-b1cf-d5062de1d75c": {"__data__": {"text": "year of free cash flow conversion above our long-term range of 90% to 95%. We continue to raise the performance bar across the organization and are confident in delivering on this 2022 guidance. In summary, we expect to deliver another year of strong topline-driven growth, along with maximized returns, driven by the strategic changes we have made in our business. There are several considerations to keep in mind for 2022. Overall, inflationary and supply chain pressures continue to impact costs across several fronts in the business, including input costs, transportation, marketing and operating expenses. With regards to commodity costs, after benefiting from our hedging strategy in 2021, we remain well hedged in 2022, but at higher levels. Based on current rates and hedge positions, we continue to expect commodity price inflation to have a mid-single-digit impact on comparable cost of goods sold in 2022. However, we are taking actions in the marketplace using multiple levers, including RGM in its many forms, along with our productivity initiatives, to help offset much of the impact. As a reminder, for your modeling, the consolidation of the recently acquired fast-growing BODYARMOR finished goods business will have a mechanical effect on margins. When it comes to capital allocation, our balance sheet remains strong, and our improving cash flow position is allowing us to be even more vigorous in pursuit of priorities that balance financial flexibility with efficient capital structure, first and foremost, to invest in our business; secondly, continuing our track record to grow our dividend; thirdly, to seek opportune M&A and to repurchase shares with excess cash. And finally, due to the calendar shift, there will be one less day in the first quarter and one additional day in the fourth quarter. Despite another year of uncertainty, in 2021, we came together as a system to emerge stronger and position ourselves to drive sustainable growth. We are encouraged by the momentum in our business and are clear on the direction we\u2019re headed. As we look to 2022, we feel confident in our ability to deliver on the commitments we outlined today.  Our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Hey. God morning. So, I wanted to focus on the 7% to 8% organic sales growth guidance for 2022, obviously, a robust level. Can you give us a bit more detail around the key drivers there? And I\u2019m wondering specifically how much of a tailwind is less COVID impact for 2022 that occurred in 2021 or above-trend pricing given the cost situation and limited demand elasticity relative to a typical year? And the point behind the question is sort of why are you above the 4% to 6% long-term algorithm? Is it more sustainable factors that can sustain as we look beyond 2022? Is it more -- factors more specific for 2022? It would be helpful to have a bit more detail there. Thanks. Sure. Good morning, Dara. Firstly, we\u2019re coming out of 2021 with good strong momentum. We\u2019ve seen an improvement on the growth rate relative to 2019, both in the at-home channels and the away-from-home channels. So, we\u2019re coming into the year with good momentum, notwithstanding some ups and downs due to Omicron in certain parts of the world in December and January. And I\u2019m going to answer the second part first. The above algorithm growth in 2022 is more primarily due to the factors of COVID and inflation, but I\u2019ll come back to that. And so, as you look out into the long term, it is much more likely we will move back into the long-term algorithm. Just to refresh, we\u2019re in a robust industry that has been growing historically. It\u2019s coming back to growth. And if that\u2019s an industry that\u2019s growing at 4% or 5%, and we have a long-term track record of gaining share in the industry, you can see why we focus attention on being in the top half of the revenue growth rate in the algorithm we put out that allows us to then drive the business into the future. So, we still think that is a sound long-term perspective in terms of both the industry growth and our ability, not", "doc_id": "09bc5086-b8f5-4b79-b1cf-d5062de1d75c", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "3b6dccb24d0ab10730fd02f2413d83ca8ae7f2a5a54b287adeacd1a30302fa2d", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 283958, "end": 288040, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "1a171871-d12d-420a-964b-19cf2e46b115", "3": "172e19df-6b98-457d-b9f5-b91bd0cd9213"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "172e19df-6b98-457d-b9f5-b91bd0cd9213": {"__data__": {"text": "sound long-term perspective in terms of both the industry growth and our ability, not just to be the leader but to be the winner in terms of share and to drive in the top half of the algorithm. Coming back to the near term and 2022, in particular, a couple of things that support an above algorithm number. Firstly, there are a number of countries that are not yet back at their 2019 levels of revenue or indeed, even volume. And whilst we are not expecting everything to be rosy in 2022, we do expect to see ongoing improvements around the world in terms of reopening, in terms of reactivation. And so, we think there are additional tailwinds in 2022 from a reopening perspective that will support the volume side. And then, in terms of pricing, clearly, it\u2019s a slightly more inflationary environment than normal. And we, as we have talked on previous calls with our bottling partners, very much look to price in the marketplace. We do have a view that we have to have brands that earn the right to take pricing. And secondly, we very much are not looking to just pass through in price but to do it intelligently because, whilst it\u2019s easy to respond to inflation by putting up the prices, there is clearly, as there is broad-based inflation, going to be a squeeze on real incomes in a number of countries. And so, we -- with very long experience in the system of managing inflationary moments when you get a squeeze on real incomes, we very much want to, yes, the company opportunities on premiumization, leverage our strong marketing, leverage our strong innovation. But we do not want to lose consumers out of the industry, so we also will have a foot in affordability. And this is a scenario where we have a lot of experience. The system has a lot of experience, and we intend to push it forward. The net of all that is likely to mean that we see a balance between volume and price/mix within the overall revenue guidance we\u2019ve given you.  Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. The first thing is not a question. It\u2019s just I\u2019m going to mention the free cash conversion and leave it at that and say, my goodness, how much things have changed. My question though was that I wanted to talk a little bit about North America supply chain. My understanding is there\u2019s -- that\u2019s still been pretty challenged. And I just was looking for any kind of update you could offer on fourth quarter and outlook into next year. Because clearly, the market share performance, everything is great, but that\u2019s still with the supply chain constraints. And I was wondering how that\u2019s shaping up. Thanks. Yes, sure. So, I think the system in the U.S. has done an exceptional job in trying to manage through all the different needles that needed to be threaded in terms of the supply chain to provide the brands for our consumers and our customers and have availability of the product. Was it perfect last year? No. Is it likely to be perfect this year? No. But, we are doing the maximum we can to optimize our full availability. And there are issues across a number of dimensions. I would say two things on the line underlie this, and we can take some examples. There is two effects going on. One, which I\u2019ve talked about on previous calls, which is the kind of the temporal supply shock. When you have a crisis, things whip around. You suddenly sell less fountain and want to sell more cans, and the system is not set up for that. And so, you get these kind of big swings, a bit like the famous case study of the video game business school. And there you get the shock waves of like in earthquake that continue to ripple through the system. And so, we saw that last year, and we will see some of that again in 2022. But they\u2019re temporal. But also there, I believe, were a set of underlying structural squeezes going on in the supply chain that perhaps had not been fully addressed by ourselves or by the industries involved, pre-COVID. And the advent of COVID just doubled down the pressure on them. So, examples of that would be trucking and freight in the", "doc_id": "172e19df-6b98-457d-b9f5-b91bd0cd9213", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "6ccb9ae13ace94886e32fddfdd627031128ba18d5640b5fcf737cc5bab03feaf", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 288030, "end": 292091, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "09bc5086-b8f5-4b79-b1cf-d5062de1d75c", "3": "cff44599-d4f7-4396-b7ff-739d98825869"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "cff44599-d4f7-4396-b7ff-739d98825869": {"__data__": {"text": "pressure on them. So, examples of that would be trucking and freight in the U.S. There\u2019s been a long-term squeeze on the availability of trucking, whether it be the hours, regulations, the aging out of the drivers. You had COVID where people didn\u2019t take the test. And so, some of these structural problems are coming home to roost. Everyone, including ourselves, are very involved in fixing them. Similarly, for example, on cans, can capacity, manufacturing accounts have been flat for a decade, but really can use and attraction that have been creeping up. And that just got squeezed as the away-from-home closed and the at-home spiked up in COVID. People are building new canning plants. New capacity is coming on line. So, I think what you\u2019re going to see play out through 2022 is the reduction in the kind of temporal amplitudes from the swings from COVID and the steady fixing of some of these structural issues that will still take some time through 2022. Obviously, we are going to do the maximum possible to leverage our portfolio of brands, our portfolio of packaging options to maximize our ability to put the drinks into the hands where the people want them and the customers want to sell them. Your next question comes from Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets. Hey. Good morning, guys. This is Filippo Falorni on for Nick. So first, on your outlook, can you discuss what level of global consumer mobility are you assuming relative to 2019 levels? And whether the lower impact that you saw from Omicron compared to prior waves gives you more confidence that your trends are decoupling from COVID cases and the away-from-home business? And if you can comment on the benefit from your recent reorganization in terms of better market share and better topline growth performance. Thank you. Well, clearly, we\u2019ve been gaining market share. And my favorite metric is market share versus 2019, both in the away-from-home and at-home channels we\u2019ve gained overall. We\u2019ve gained in the away-from-home and we\u2019ve gained in the at-home. And we are -- in terms of consumer business, we are assuming a greater degree of reopening. We can certainly begin to see that in Europe as the Omicron variant has moved through. The U.S., just this week, mask mandates are coming down. So, there is going to be an improvement in mobility across the world. It\u2019s not going to be back to 2019 fully in 2022. And I think that\u2019s going to be true, both in terms of domestic mobility and international mobility, I don\u2019t know if you meant per country or people moving around the world. But anyway, the answer is basically the same, which is we are assuming an improvement in mobility, but we\u2019re not assuming a return yet to the full 2019 levels. Your next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. John, I had a question just about the guidance. And if we look at the currency neutral spread between earnings growth and organic sales growth, can you just give us a little bit more color in terms of where the leverage in the income statement will be? Because the tax rates moving up, interest expense, net interest expense, I guess, will be higher because of the BODYARMOR deal. So, it didn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s a lot of leverage below the operating income line. So, I was just trying to get a better understanding of just where the leverage is in the net -- on the P&L. Thanks, Bryan. Yes, on the -- as you walk down through the P&L, currency neutral, I think on the first point is top line is very robust. We have done a really nice job, I think, going into \u201822 on optimizing to our RGM efforts and the innovation pipeline that we have at play. And then, secondly, coming out of the reorg work that we\u2019ve done over the last couple of years, we are doing I think a much tighter job on overall resource allocation, finding a good balance between investing as we need to for -- to support the top line, but also taking into account the opportunities that we have driven in the efficiency work that we have done. So, I feel confident that we have some flex from the gross", "doc_id": "cff44599-d4f7-4396-b7ff-739d98825869", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "9a0c24348618116c4de0fc7666e6f3c6810add37502550d79af889c7fe55ec93", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 292102, "end": 296161, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "172e19df-6b98-457d-b9f5-b91bd0cd9213", "3": "b3188a9a-0a53-4ad0-b14a-cf70123a7137"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "b3188a9a-0a53-4ad0-b14a-cf70123a7137": {"__data__": {"text": "work that we have done.

And below the operating line are actually our net interest expense, given the tremendous work we\u2019ve done to completely restructure our debt portfolio, is actually a net benefit for us in 2022. Your next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala from Credit Suisse. A couple of things on just kind of understanding the balance between the pricing needs of your own and the commodity inflation you\u2019re seeing versus the kind of pricing needs of your bottlers? I certainly understand that you work as a system, but you\u2019re obviously different businesses and different regions and such. So, how do you work that balance between the two? Let me separate the businesses into the vast majority of the business, which goes through the bottling system, and then some businesses that go in parallel. When we\u2019re talking about pricing needs of the concentrate business a bit that goes through the bottler, in the almost all cases, we have a system whereby we operate what\u2019s called incidence pricing. So, we have agreements with the bottlers where our revenue will be a percent of the revenues that they achieve in the marketplace. So therefore, we are both incentivized to work diligently to increase the total size of the pie in a much more aligned way in terms of both trying to drive the same outcome. So, in that sense, the bottlers -- we work together and the bottlers take the pricing in the marketplace, whether it\u2019s rate pricing or working on the mix between the brands and the packages and the channels, and then we take a percentage of that. And of course, we\u2019re both looking at the various input cost challenges that we have, and we work through and come up with a pricing plan, and the bottlers take that to the marketplace and get it done. We do have a few businesses where we sell the finished goods, whether that be some of the, for example, the chilled juice businesses here in the U.S. or in Europe or the Costa business or the BIG business. Clearly, there, we\u2019re operating the vertically integrated businesses, and we\u2019re doing very much what we do with the bottlers we do our own for those businesses, and we work it all through. So, I think you can take it as we work very much in alignment working back from the consumer, trying to drive value for the customers. And we manage the portfolio of all the different input costs, including our needs to kind of invest in marketing, invest in innovation and invest in execution capacity as the bottlers would do. Your next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JP Morgan. My question is on the pricing that you embed in your guide. And is it pricing actions yet to be implemented or already in the market? And can you elaborate a bit more on -- James, on your commentary about balancing volumes and pricing in 2022, which implies you probably expect an additional low-single-digit volume growth in 2022. And is that predicated mostly on the on-premise recovering as you pointed out, and an improvement in supply of cans and how we should parse it out? Thank you very much.  Sure. So, yes, clearly by saying we\u2019re expecting a balance between volume and price, ['Bryan Spillane', 'Kaumil Gajrawala', 'John Murphy', 'Tim Leveridge', 'James Quincey', 'Filippo Falorni', 'Dara Mohsenian', 'Operator', 'Lauren Lieberman', 'Andrea Teixeira']\n9, ABBV, 4, 2021, 2022-02-02 13:44:06, Good morning, and thanks for joining us.

Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. I\u2019ll provide perspective on our overall performance and outlook, and then Jeff, Mike and Rob will review our quarterly business highlights, pipeline progress, financial results and guidance for 2022 in more detail.  Our performances this quarter tops off another excellent year for AbbVie with results well above our initial expectations. We delivered full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share of $12.70, representing growth of more than 20% versus the prior year. Full-year adjusted net revenues were more than $56 billion, up 10.5% on a comparable operational basis. These results demonstrate balanced performance across each of our major growth franchises, including double-digit comparable operational revenue growth from immunology, aesthetics, and neuroscience. I\u2019m extremely pleased with our momentum, and we\u2019ve entered this year in a strong position, which is reflected in our guidance. We anticipate 2022 adjusted earnings per share of $14 to $14.20, representing growth of 11% at the midpoint. Longer-term, we remain well positioned with an impressive set of diversified growth assets. In immunology, Skyrizi and Rinvoq are already contributing meaningful revenue, including $4.6 billion in combined sales last year with substantial growth anticipated in 2022 and beyond. Over the next few months, we expect to add several new indications to the list of approved uses for these two assets, at which point, Skyrizi and Rinvoq will be commercialized across all of Humira\u2019s major indications, plus atopic dermatitis. With the strong performance that we\u2019re seeing in their initial indications and the robust data we\u2019ve demonstrated across our broad development programs, we expect combined peak sales for Skyrizi and Rinvoq to exceed the peak revenues achieved by Humira.  In hematological oncology, we\u2019ve established a leading position with Imbruvica and Venclexta, which were both expected to remain important revenue contributors through the decade. To support our next wave of growth, we also have an exciting and diverse pipeline of promising new therapies to address critical unmet needs in both blood cancers and solid tumors. Notable opportunities from our mid to late stage oncology pipeline include Navitoclax for myelofibrosis, which has the potential to provide disease modification in a market where current treatments only address symptoms.

An approval in major depressive disorder represents upside to our current projections.

And we remain active with business development to pursue promising external technologies and complementary opportunities, including the recently closed Soliton acquisition, which further expands our body contouring portfolio. Given this focus and investment, we expect our aesthetics franchise to deliver high single digit revenue growth, through the end of the decade, including sales of more than $9 billion in 2029. Lastly, we\u2019ve developed a robust pipeline, including numerous attractive late-stage programs, novel early stage therapies in a growing range of potential platform technologies, which we expect will collectively contribute to our growth through the decade. With the actions that we\u2019ve taken to diversify our sources of growth, we remain very confident in the long-term outlook for our business. Following the U.S. Humira LOE event in 2023, we expect to quickly return to growth in 2024 and deliver high-single-digit growth from 2025 to the end of the decade. This is a testament to the strength of AbbVie\u2019s broad and balanced portfolio. In summary, this is an exciting time for our Company. We\u2019re demonstrating excellent execution across our portfolio, and our long-term growth prospects remain very strong. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff? Thank you, Rick. Looking at our quarterly results, we continue to demonstrate excellent commercial execution across our therapeutic portfolio. I\u2019ll start with immunology, which delivered global revenues of more than $6.7 billion, reflecting growth of 13.3% on an operational basis. Global Humira sales were $5.3 billion, up 3.5%, with 6% revenue growth in the U.S. offset by biosimilar competition across the international markets, where revenues were down 8.8% on an operational basis. Skyrizi is performing extremely well. Global sales of nearly $900 million were up 12.4% on a sequential basis, reflecting continued market share gains. Skyrizi has now surpassed Humira as the leader for total prescriptions in the U.S. psoriasis biological market, with share of approximately 20%. We are also now leading the market in several international geographies, including Japan. Total in-place share, which includes both new and switching patients, remains very and now, reflects roughly 37% patient share in the U.S. as well as leadership in nearly 20 key countries around the world. Skyrizi is also now approved for its second", "doc_id": "c967140b-78a3-4158-a9bb-5372514a3cd9", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "797c4a7e5d0bba1e9af7745401501331ea9ebd5a39db1f9b3d12a5f4fcc47a29", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 304273, "end": 308400, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "80911d92-10f8-4e74-989c-755806c0d7e6", "3": "42d03d2b-e9e5-47f8-a77c-abcfff5fc6ba"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "42d03d2b-e9e5-47f8-a77c-abcfff5fc6ba": {"__data__": {"text": "nearly 20 key countries around the world. Skyrizi is also now approved for its second major indication, to treat adults with active psoriatic arthritis, further enhancing its compelling profile in dermatology. Field promotion is now active globally and early feedback from physicians has been very positive. Given Skyrizi\u2019s demonstrated skin clearance and joint efficacy in our PSA clinical program, with nearly 30% of patients visiting dermatologists, having both, skin and joint involvement, this new approval will sustain Skyrizi\u2019s strong momentum. In addition, we are preparing for the launch of Skyrizi\u2019s in Crohn\u2019s disease, an indication with very meaningful long-term revenue potential, with regulatory approvals in both, the U.S. and Europe anticipated this year. Rinvoq also continues to demonstrate robust growth. Global sales of more than $500 million were up 14% on a sequential basis. Prescriptions in RA remain strong with a total market share of more than 5.5% in the U.S. and nearly 5% across key international markets. We\u2019re very pleased with the competitive labels for both PSA and atopic dermatitis, where we are making excellent progress with their launches globally. In atopic dermatitis, dermatologists appreciate key elements of Rinvoq\u2019s new label, including the incorporation of stringent skin and itch endpoints, reflective of the performance in our registrational trials, as well as an adolescent indication and dosing flexibility. Managed care access is expected to ramp fairly quickly for both atopic dermatitis and PSA in the U.S. We are also preparing for the launches of Rinvoq in ulcerative colitis and axial SpA with regulatory approvals for both indications anticipated this year as well. Overall, we continue to feel very good about the performance and progress we\u2019re making with both, Rinvoq and Skyrizi, which are expected to contribute more than $15 billion in combined risk adjusted global sales in 2025. In hematologic oncology, global revenues were nearly $1.9 billion, up 4.7% on an operational basis. Venclexta once again, delivered robust growth. Sales were up 34% on an operational basis with strong share performance across all approved indications. Imbruvica global revenues were down 2.7%, reflecting a slower than anticipated market recovery in CLL and increased share pressure from newer therapies. In neuroscience, revenues were more than $1.6 billion, up 19% on an operational basis, including robust double-digit growth for both, Vraylar and Botox Therapeutic. I\u2019m also very pleased with our performance in migraine, where we have a portfolio of multiple distinct therapies to address the full spectrum of this disease. This includes our two leading oral CGRP therapies. Ubrelvy for acute migraine, which delivered total sales of $183 million, up 13% on a sequential basis, we anticipate robust sales growth again this year based on Ubrelvy\u2019s competitive profile, continued strong new patient starts and a rapidly expanding CGRP segment. And we also have Qulipta, the only oral CGRP treatment specifically developed for the prevention of episodic migraine. The launch is going extremely well. When considering both paid and bridge volume Qulipta is already capturing nearly 20% of the new-to-brand share in the preventative CGRP class. Roughly three months post-launch, this is an incredible accomplishment and it\u2019s a testament to Qulipta\u2019s demonstrated efficacy, including rapid and meaningful reduction in migraine days. We expect commercial access for Qulipta to ramp quickly in the first half of this year. In eye care, revenues of $960 million were up 3.9% on an operational basis, including $364 million in sales from Restasis. Lastly, Mavyret were $427 million, down 10.1% on an operational basis, as treated patient volumes remained suppressed compared to pre-COVID levels.

Overall, I\u2019m very pleased with the performance and the momentum across the therapeutic portfolio. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike? Thank you, Jeff. We made significant advancement across all stages of our pipeline in 2021, and we expect continued progress again this year. In immunology, we had several recent important regulatory updates. We implemented safety and indication updates to our RA label for Rinvoq, and also received FDA approval in psoriatic arthritis and atopic dermatitis to curing strong labels that highlight Rinvoq\u2019s favorable benefit risk profile in both new indications. In atopic dermatitis, we received approval for both the 15 milligram and 30 milligram doses, and based on the impressive levels of skin clearance and itch reduction demonstrated in our development program, we believe Rinvoq will be an important new treatment option for adult and adolescent patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, who have not responded well to other systemic agents, such as cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, or biologics. We also have regulatory applications under review for Rinvoq in ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis, and non-radiographic axial SpA. We expect an FDA approval decision next month for ulcerative colitis, in the second quarter for ankylosing spondylitis, and in the fourth quarter for non-radiographic axial SpA. In Europe, we anticipate approval decisions for ulcerative colitis and non-radiographic axial SpA in the second half of the year. We\u2019re nearing completion of Rinvoq\u2019s registrational program in Crohn\u2019s disease, which is the last major indication expansion program for Rinvoq. We recently announced positive top-line results from the first Phase 3 Crohn\u2019s induction study, where Rinvoq demonstrated a very impact on clinical remission and endoscopic response in a difficult-to-treat refractory patient population. We expect to see results from the second Phase 3 Crohn\u2019s induction study and from the maintenance study in the first half of this year with regulatory submissions anticipated in the second half of 2022. Also in immunology, we recently received FDA approval for Skyrizi in psoriatic arthritis, an important indication expansion for this asset. Based on the strong joint efficacy and the high level of skin clearance that Skyrizi provided in our registrational trials, we believe Skyrizi will be very competitively positioned as an effective new treatment option for psoriatic arthritis patients. We also have regulatory applications under review for Skyrizi in Crohn\u2019s disease with approval decisions expected in the U.S. next month and in Europe, later this year. We\u2019ve seen impressive results in our Crohn\u2019s disease program, and we believe Skyrizi has the potential to become an important new therapy in this market, where there continues to be considerable unmet need. We\u2019re making very good progress with our early-stage immunology pipeline as well, where we are developing novel agents with the goal of significantly advancing the standard-of-care across our core areas, by providing deeper and more durable responses. Our anti-TNF steroid ADC ABBV-154 is a novel approach for delivering a potent steroid that has the potential to provide durable remission in diseases such as RA, PMR and Crohn\u2019s disease. We expect to see preliminary data from our Phase 2 dose ranging study in RA in the fourth quarter of this year. We also expect to see Phase 2 proof-of-concept data in PMR and Crohn\u2019s disease in 2023. In dermatology, our early-stage efforts are focused on developing oral agents that can provide clear skin with durable responses. Our RoR\u03b3T inverse agonist, ABBV-157 is designed to more effectively inhibit IL-17 production compared to pure antagonists, which has the potential to result in a greater impact on skin inflammation.

We\u2019ve recently been again a Phase 2 dose ranging study for 157 in psoriasis. Moving to oncology, where we continue to make good progress across all stages of our pipeline. We recently received an FDA breakthrough therapy designation for Teliso-V in second line plus advanced or metastatic nonsquamous, non-small cell lung cancer, based on the encouraging results we\u2019ve seen to-date in our clinical program. Treatment options for patients who have exhausted platinum-based chemotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapy are limited to single agent chemo, which typically provides response rates of only 15% to 20%, with a median overall survival of less than one year. Prognosis for these patients is very poor. While targeted therapies have been approved by the FDA for the 3% to 4% of non-small cell lung cancer patients, harboring MET exon 14 skipping mutations, there are currently no therapies approved, specifically for the much larger group of patients, who exhibit c-Met protein overexpression. Patients with overexpressed c-Met represents about 25% to 30% of the advanced or metastatic nonsquamous, non-small cell lung cancer population with wild-type EGFR, which corresponds to an incidence of approximately 35,000 patients each year in the U.S. In stage 1 of our Phase 2 study, we saw promising efficacy in heavily pretreated patients who received Teliso-V, including a 54% objective response rate in those with highly expressed c-Met. The second stage of the Phase 2 study is ongoing and has the potential to support an accelerated approval in second-line plus advanced metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer. We expect to see additional data from this study next year. We also recently began the clinical program for our next-generation c-Met ADC, ABBV-400, which utilizes a more potent topoisomerase inhibitor payload to potentially drive deeper tumor responses in patients with both, intermediate and high levels of c-Met expression. We also expect to see data this year from several important indication expansion programs for Venclexta, including results from the Phase 3 CANOVA trial in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients with a t(11;14) mutation as well as results from our program for Venclexta in previously untreated higher-risk MDS patients, where we received a breakthrough therapy designation. We plan to submit our regulatory applications to the FDA in the first half of this year for an accelerated approval in MDS, and late in \u201822 or early \u201823 for multiple myeloma. Both indications represent important expansion opportunities for Venclexta and will help drive long-term growth for our oncology portfolio. We are also making very good progress with epcoritamab, where we continue to generate strong data in early-stage studies to support our view that epcoritamab has the potential to become a differentiated and best-in-class CD3xCD20 bispecific across several B-cell malignancies including diffuse B cell and follicular lymphomas. We\u2019ll see monotherapy data in the third quarter from the Phase 2 expansion cohort in DLBCL, which has the potential to support a submission for accelerated approval in the second half of this year. We also have a Phase 3 study ongoing in third-line relapsed/refractory DLBCL and we plan to initiate several additional Phase 3 trials this year, including studies in earlier lines of therapy for diffuse B-cell lymphoma in multiple combinations, as well as in follicular lymphoma in combination with rituximab and Revlimid. This year, we\u2019ll also see additional data maturing from our cohort expansion studies for ABBV-383, both as a monotherapy and in combination with standard-of-care and novel agents in multiple myeloma. We believe our BCMA-CD3 bispecific has the potential to be differentiated on efficacy, safety and dosing interval and can be best-in-class across multiple lines of therapy.

We plan to initiate Phase 3 studies later this year in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. We also continue to make good progress with Navitoclax in myelofibrosis, where we\u2019ve seen strong mid-stage data supporting our view that Navitoclax has the potential to provide disease modification, which we believe will lead to improved and durable clinical outcomes for patients. We expect a Phase 3 data readout and regulatory submissions in the first half of next year, with approval anticipated near the end of 2023. Moving to neuroscience, where we expect several important pipeline events in 2022 as well. We recently completed discussions with the FDA and are preparing to submit our application for Vraylar as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder. Based on the totality of the data and the strong benefit-risk profile demonstrated in our clinical program, we believe Vraylar has the potential to be competitively positioned as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder. We expect a submission in the first quarter and an approval decision by the end of the year. We\u2019ve also completed our registration-enabling program for ABBV-951, our novel subcutaneous levodopa/carbidopa delivery system for treatment of advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease. In our Phase 3 studies, 951 proved superior to oral levodopa/carbidopa in reducing motor fluctuations in this advanced population, and we believe our innovative new delivery system represents a potentially transformative improvement to current treatment options. We remain on track to submit our regulatory applications in the first half of this year in the U.S. and Europe, with both approval decisions anticipated in early 2023. And we expect to see Phase 3 data for Qulipta in chronic migraine prevention later in the first quarter and plan to submit our regulatory applications in both, the U.S. and Europe this summer, with approval decisions expected in the first half of 2023. So, in summary, we remain focused on continuing to execute on our pipeline programs and anticipate numerous important regulatory and clinical milestones across all stages of our pipeline in 2022. This includes important indication expansion for on-market drugs and data readouts and regulatory actions for key late-stage assets as well as proof-of-concept data from several early-stage NME programs. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our fourth quarter performance and our 2022 financial outlook. Rob? Thank you, Mike. AbbVie once again delivered outstanding performance while also advancing our strategic priorities. The strong results across our portfolio continue to support AbbVie\u2019s long-term growth outlook. Starting with fourth quarter results. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.31, up 13.4% compared to prior year and $0.05 above our guidance midpoint. Total adjusted net revenues were $14.9 billion, up 7.5% on an operational basis, excluding a 0.1% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 49.3% of sales, an improvement of 240 basis points versus the prior year. This includes adjusted gross margin of 83.6% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 12.1% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of 22.2% of sales. Net interest expense was $571 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 12.5%. Shifting to 2022, our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance is between $14 and $14.20, reflecting growth of 11% at the midpoint. Excluded from this guidance is $4.74 of known intangible amortization and specified items. We expect adjusted net revenue of approximately $60 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 0.8% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. This revenue forecast comprehends the following approximate assumptions for our key products and therapeutic areas. We expect Immunology Global sales to grow double digits, including U.S. Humira growth of 8%, International Humira revenue of $2.6 billion at current exchange rates, Skyrizi Global", "doc_id": "f7defbe0-d708-4d4b-96fe-04ad45bba34d", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "65c60f9af735cd950ae8add25bcd7bd46059eb748b220aaef5d1474197560a26", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 320190, "end": 324240, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "dda57c14-6a3e-40de-8b66-44ece9b49015", "3": "e3819f2c-adda-4982-8e0b-ee8d9a243e55"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "e3819f2c-adda-4982-8e0b-ee8d9a243e55": {"__data__": {"text": "Humira revenue of $2.6 billion at current exchange rates, Skyrizi Global sales of $4.4 billion and Rinvoq Global sales of $2.7 billion. In hematologic oncology, we expect Venclexta global sales of $2.3 billion and Imbruvica global revenue of $5.4 billion. The Imbruvica forecast assumes market recovery in CLL, offset by share erosion from increased competition. For aesthetics, we expect global sales of $5.9 billion, including $2.6 billion for Botox Cosmetic and $1.7 billion from Juvederm. For neuroscience, we expect global revenue of $6.9 billion, including Botox Therapeutic sales of $2.7 billion, Vraylar sales of $2.2 billion, Ubrelvy sales of $800 million and Qulipta sales of $200 million with commercial access increasing rapidly in the first half of the year. For eye care, we expect global sales of $2.9 billion, including $700 million from Restasis, which assumes no generic competition in the first half of 2022. Lastly, we expect Mavyret global revenue of $1.7 billion. Looking at the P&L for 2022, we are forecasting full year adjusted gross margin of approximately 84% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of approximately $6.8 billion and adjusted SG&A expense of approximately $12.7 billion. This guidance includes approximately $2.5 billion in expense synergies from the Allergan acquisition. We are forecasting the adjusted operating margin ratio to expand by 120 basis points to approximately 51.5% of sales. We expect adjusted net interest expense approaching $2.2 billion, our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 12.7% and our share count to be roughly flat to 2021. Turning to the first quarter, we anticipate net revenue approaching $13.5 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.3% unfavorable impact on sales growth. This revenue forecast comprehends the following approximate assumptions for our key therapeutic areas: Immunology sales of $6.2 billion, HemOnc revenue of $1.7 billion, aesthetic sales of $1.3 billion, neuroscience revenue of $1.5 billion and eye care sales of $900 million. We are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 51% of sales, and we model a non-GAAP tax rate of 12.4%. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.10 and $3.14, excluding approximately $1.22 of known intangible amortization and specified items. Finally, AbbVie\u2019s strong business performance and outlook continue to support our capital allocation priorities. We expect to generate adjusted free cash flow of approximately $24 billion in 2022, which is net of roughly $1 billion in Skyrizi royalty payments. This cash flow will fully support a strong and growing dividend, which we have increased by more than 250% since inception; continued debt repayment, where we expect to pay down just above $12 billion of debt in 2022 and estimate a net leverage ratio of 1.8 times by the end of the year. Our strong cash flow also allows for continued business development, with approximately $2 billion allocated annually to augment our pipeline with the most promising external technologies and innovative therapies. In closing, we are very pleased to AbbVie\u2019s strong results in 2021. And we expect to deliver robust performance in 2022 and over the long term. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Liz. Thanks, Rob. We will now open the call for questions. In the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or two. Operator, we\u2019ll take the first question. Thank you. Our first question comes from Chris Schott with JP Morgan. Great. Thanks so much for the questions. I just have a couple here digging into Rinvoq in a little bit more detail.

It\u2019s probably not hugely surprising given label revision, but just elaborate a little bit more on the feedback you\u2019re getting from physicians there. And when you anticipate you\u2019ll start to see sequential growth again in that indication? The second question I had on Rinvoq was then on atopic derm. Just elaborate again a little bit more on the ramp you\u2019re expecting here. Is this something that\u2019s going to take some time, or do you view that there\u2019s some low-hanging fruit maybe with some of the DP failures? I\u2019m really just trying to get to with all of these is, I guess, the $2.7 billion guidance, how much of that\u2019s RA? How much of it is new indication? Just a little bit more color on that front. Thanks so much. Yes. Thanks. Hi. It\u2019s Jeff. I\u2019ll give you some sense on what\u2019s happening with RA. So, the RA market after the drug safety and label is progressing as we anticipated. So, I\u2019ll give you some sense, and I\u2019ll refer to sort of in-play share because you have to be a little bit careful in the December, January time frame with overall volumes in the market. But right before the Drug Safety Communication, we had about a 16% in-place share in RA, which was just right behind Humira. So very, very strong. If we look at where that\u2019s trended over the fourth quarter, it\u2019s dropped about 20%. Okay? So, it\u2019s about 14 reported in October, just over 13 in November, very consistent with what we thought would happen. So, about a 20% shift in new-to-brand starts over that time period. And what we see from the market is it\u2019s exactly as we would expect, very, very stable, no change really in second-line plus and doctors start to suppress their starts in first-line consistent with the label. So, what we\u2019re going to see is that as basically the promotion kicks back in here after December in the first quarter, we\u2019re going to see that type of stability, which we can see is very, very clear from our overall share in our weeklies and start to progress as we shift and pivot towards that second-line plus. So, the market is responding very similar to our expectations that we\u2019ve been talking about in terms of overall RA. Obviously, PsA is going to help build upon that RA dynamic and then ultimately, later in the year, the big axial approvals as well. So, everything is progressing as we thought it would progress from a market perspective. In terms of atopic dermatitis, listen, I said in my prepared remarks, we\u2019re very pleased with the label. We have those stringent endpoints of the EASI 90, the high skin clearance, very powerful itch reduction are reflected in our label. We obviously have both doses approved. The market, I can tell you, has been very pleasantly surprised about the adolescent indication, which is -- it\u2019s very important. So, that\u2019s basically -- we\u2019re going to start to see that ramp. It won\u2019t -- we don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be slow. And to your point, in terms of our ability to start to capture patients, it\u2019s happening already. We obviously haven\u2019t reported any of the TRxs yet, but we can see it in the market. And typically, it\u2019s falling into a couple of areas. First, dupi failures, not a surprise, and there\u2019s a reasonably significant number of people after 4 or 5 years that just have failed and exited the market. They\u2019re going to come back in. We have reports from our research and our teams over partial responders to dupi that just aren\u2019t doing well, in particular with the itch. We see some early starts there. And then, of course, challenging patients in general, we are seeing starts there as well with those higher levels of skin involvement. So the market seems to be progressing as we expected. It\u2019s not surprising that as we look at the development of the second-line market, we\u2019re", "doc_id": "c22b26c8-82f1-4956-9963-af3c09b39d06", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "a8680585478d0fb922b382fa725f8b238ccc64c0828a6f56dd0265556cfcb0a8", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 328067, "end": 331866, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "e3819f2c-adda-4982-8e0b-ee8d9a243e55", "3": "c99abdb4-b803-4d46-b262-4afe3217ffcb"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "c99abdb4-b803-4d46-b262-4afe3217ffcb": {"__data__": {"text": "surprising that as we look at the development of the second-line market, we\u2019re going to see initially most of the starts in the dupi partial responders or the nonresponders, which is a fairly significant population.

Maybe I can turn it over to Rob to give a sense over the relative magnitude of the sales. Thanks, Jeff. Chris, this is Rob. So of the Rinvoq guidance of $2.7 billion, the AD and spine indications will each contribute a couple of hundred million dollars, while UC will contribute around $100 million.

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Tammy Munsey, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Good afternoon. It's my pleasure to welcome everyone to the Walt Disney Company's fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www. disney. com/investors. Today's call is also being webcast and we'll post a transcript of this call to our website. Joining me remotely today are Bob Chapek, Disney's Chief Executive Officer, and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Christine, we'll of course, be happy to take some of your questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to get started. Thanks, Tammy, and good afternoon, everyone. As we close out the fourth quarter, I'm pleased to say that it's been a very productive year for The Walt Disney Company. As we've made great strides in reopening our business, while also taking meaningful and innovative steps to position ourselves for continued long-term growth. Despite the many ongoing challenges of the pandemic, we ended the quarter with adjusted EPS of $0.37 compared to a loss of $0.20 last year. Christine will go more in-depth on the quarter and the coming year in her remarks. Last quarter, we talked about our strategic priorities for the future. And as we head into fiscal '22, we remain keenly focused on advancing them to drive our continued growth. First and foremost, telling the world's most original enduring stories. Second, maximizing the synergy of our unique ecosystem to deepen consumers' connection to our characters and our stories. And lastly, using the power of our far reaching platforms and new technologies to give consumers the best entertainment experience possible.  I'll briefly talk about how we are executing against these priorities in 3 key areas: Direct-to-Consumer, sports, and Parks, Experiences, and Products. On the Direct-to-Consumer side, we are extremely pleased with the success of our portfolio streaming services. Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu continue to perform incredibly well with a 118.1 million, 17.1 million, and 43.8 million subscribers, respectively, for a total of a 179 million subscriptions. To put this growth in perspective, in the past fiscal year alone, we have grown the total number of subscriptions across our DTC portfolio by 48%, and Disney+ subs", "doc_id": "c99abdb4-b803-4d46-b262-4afe3217ffcb", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "0490047ee887c3e87352431c320308c8ef878954cce82c7f503704da82f7da72", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 331855, "end": 335841, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "c22b26c8-82f1-4956-9963-af3c09b39d06", "3": "71bda5ed-ff2e-47e8-b595-c3f532f99122"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "71bda5ed-ff2e-47e8-b595-c3f532f99122": {"__data__": {"text": "number of subscriptions across our DTC portfolio by 48%, and Disney+ subs in particular by 60%. I want to reiterate that we remain focused on managing our DTC business for the long-term, not quarter-to-quarter. And we're confident we are on the right trajectory to achieve the guidance that we provided at last year's Investors Day, reaching between 230 million and 260 million paid Disney+ subscribers globally by the end of fiscal year 2024, and with Disney+ achieving profitability that same year.  This Friday, we will celebrate the 2-year anniversary of the launch of Disney+ with our first ever Disney+ Day of global, Company-wide celebration. We are enormously proud of all that we've accomplished with the service in just the first 2 years. It has exceeded our wildest expectations, and we are so excited for what's to come. With this in mind, we have numerous activations planned across the entire Company for Disney+ Day, including the streaming premiere of Marvel Shang-Chi and The Legend of the Ten Rings, which has already surpassed $430 million at the global box office. Other content coming to the service on Disney+ Day includes the highly anticipated Disney+ original movie, Home Sweet Home Alone, the epic adventure, Jungle Cruise, and a hilarious new short from The Simpsons, and the first 5 episodes of season 2 of the fantastic National Geographic series, The World According to Jeff Goldblum.  And there's more great content in the pipeline. On the heels of Disney+ Day, we'll premiere 2 amazing new original series, Marvel's Hawkeye on November 24th, and the latest Star Wars adventure, The Book of Boba Fett on December 29th. And of course, we're extremely excited about the Thanksgiving holiday weekend debut of  Get Back, Peter Jackson's highly anticipated 3-part documentary. Additionally, Marvel's Eternals, which has reached more than $161 million at the global box office in less than a week and Disney's Encanto, which premieres in theaters on November 24th, will come to the service after their exclusive theatrical runs. In total, we are nearly doubling the amount of original content from our marquee brands, Disney, Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars, and National Geographic coming to Disney+ in FY '22, with the majority of our highly anticipated titles arriving July through September.  This represents the beginning of the surge of new content shared last December at our investor conference 2.0. We recognize that the single most effective way to grow our streaming platforms worldwide is with great content. And we are singularly focused on making new, high-quality entertainment, including local and regional content that we believe will resonate with audiences. Of note, we have 340 plus local original titles in various stages of development and production for our DTC platforms over the next few years. As you know, we announced at our last Investor Day that we expect our total content expense to be between $8 and $9 billion in fiscal 2024, and we will now be increasing that investment further with the primary driver being more local and regional content. We are expanding our global reach by introducing Disney+ in additional markets around the world.  The service is now available throughout Japan and we're thrilled to be launching it this Friday on Disney+ Day in South Korea, in Taiwan, and in Hong Kong on November 16. In just 2 short years, we're now in over 60 countries and more than 20 languages. And next year, we plan to bring Disney+ to consumers in 50 plus additional countries, including in Central, Eastern Europe, The Middle East, and South Africa. Our goal is to more than double the number of countries we are currently in to over 160 by fiscal year '23. Turning to Sports, we continue to build out ESPN+ with exclusive sports content that makes our DTC offering the perfect complement to the ESPN linear experience. And with every new sports rights deal, we have considered both linear and DTC. In fact, all 7 of the major deals we made in the last year-and-a-half included a streaming component.  Among them is our historic 10-year NFL rights agreement, which begins in 2023. We also recently signed a 5-year deal with the league for Monday night Wild Card game, which runs through 2025. Another example is our 7-year", "doc_id": "71bda5ed-ff2e-47e8-b595-c3f532f99122", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "64455ce0a046563f59a27e5c92264ddc31ec3a35777c7b69218b75c0b95285b3", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 335846, "end": 340123, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "c99abdb4-b803-4d46-b262-4afe3217ffcb", "3": "98a4418c-3f4b-4bac-a026-9e259ff0fd65"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "98a4418c-3f4b-4bac-a026-9e259ff0fd65": {"__data__": {"text": "for Monday night Wild Card game, which runs through 2025. Another example is our 7-year rights deal with the NHL, 75 of the League's live national games are and will be available exclusively on ESPN+ and Hulu. And ESPN+ is the sole home for more than 1,000 out-of-market NHL games. By the way, this is another reason that Disney Bundle is proving highly appealing to consumers. Because live sports are key element, and a key differentiator of our Disney ecosystem. Some 90% of the most-watched telecast last year were sports, and they continue to perform extremely well. For example, the NHL's opening night games on ESPN last month marked the highest viewed season opening doubleheader on record, with an increase of 54% over the 2019/2020 season opening day letter.  And we are particularly pleased with the NHL 's Direct-to-Consumer performance on ESPN+ and Hulu. Likewise, the hugely popular UFC, fresh off a strong card at Madison Square Garden last weekend, continues to be a top performer for ESPN+ with 6 of the top UFC on ESPN+ pay-per-views coming in the past year. At the same time, we continue to expand our original sports programming with innovative broadcast like the hugely popular Monday Night Football with Peyton and Eli, which airs on ESPN2, and reached 1.9 million viewers by its second week, as well as the highly anticipated new shows like Man in the  Tom Brady, the multi-part docuseries about the legendary quarterback premiering on ESPN+ on November 16, along with a host of fantastic new social and digital shows and podcast.  We're also moving towards a greater presence in online sports betting. And given our reaching scale, we have the potential to partner with third-parties in this space in a very meaningful way. Suffice to say, we continue to see enormous opportunity in sports, and all of this, the right steels, our innovative programming, and the flexibility achieved through our DTC business, which saw ESPN+ subscribers, increased by 66% over the past fiscal year alone. All of this is a testament to the clear ambition we have in sports. One of the things that sets The Walt Disney Company apart is our unique access to an incredible number of consumer touch points across our businesses. That, of course, includes our parks and resorts, where we've achieved a number of important milestones since our last earnings call, including the first full quarter since the pandemic began with all of our Parks around the world open to guests, albeit with some limits on capacity, and the return of our entire Disney Cruise Line.  At the same time, the U.S. government's approval of vaccines for 5 to 11-year-olds, and the reopening of borders to fully vaccinated international travelers are both important steps towards the recovery of our business. But what is perhaps most exciting is the work that we have done during the time our Parks were closed to re-engineer and re-imagine the guest experience. We have introduced a number of exciting new offerings that enable guests to create their best Disney Day. In late August, Disneyland Resort launched Magic Key, the new annual membership program that is resonating strongly with Legacy Annual Passholders, while also attracting new passholders. In fact, about 40% of current sales are to new passholders. And most Magic Key holders have purchased the top 2 tiers, Dream Key and Believe Key. With Dream Key selling out in just 2 months.  We're also seeing a great response to the new Annual Passholder program at Walt Disney World. A testament to the demand for our in-park experiences and the success of our yield management strategy. Walt Disney World rolled out its new multi-tiered full service app, Disney Genie, which allows guests to easily and efficiently navigate everything our parks have to offer in order to have the best experience possible. The response to the service in just its first month has been extremely positive. The majority of Genie and Genie+ users have said it improved their overall park experience with nearly 1/3 of park guests upgrading to Genie+, making it possible for them to spend less time waiting in line and more time enjoying attractions, entertainment, dining, and retail opportunities. We are very encouraged by what we're seeing and look forward to", "doc_id": "98a4418c-3f4b-4bac-a026-9e259ff0fd65", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "2dc47bfc3ca73579336497893208d6d3bfd75323d4a1a8fcf29eab4cb2d0b900", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 340113, "end": 344387, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "71bda5ed-ff2e-47e8-b595-c3f532f99122", "3": "df54a214-cda7-4b30-be8b-5052eba751e4"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "df54a214-cda7-4b30-be8b-5052eba751e4": {"__data__": {"text": "opportunities. We are very encouraged by what we're seeing and look forward to launching Disney Genie at Disneyland very soon.  Alongside these transformative programs, we continue to invest in our parks and resorts themselves. We introduced a host of new attractions as part of Walt Disney World's 50th anniversary celebration, which kicked off on October 1st. These include Remy's Ratatouille Adventure at EPCOT, which has quickly become one of the parks top attractions, our new themed restaurant SPACE 220, and Two New Nighttime Spectaculars. And there is lots more in store in the coming month, including the highly anticipated indoor coaster Guardians of the  Cosmic Rewind, and the one-of-a-kind Galactic Starcruiser experience. As part of this immersive 2-night adventure, guests will become heroes of their own Star Wars stories. Reservations went on sale just 3 weeks ago, and the first 4 months of voyages have virtually sold out for this premium experience.  Disney Cruise Line continues to be one of the highest rated guest experiences of any of our offerings. As I said earlier, all 4 of our ships are now sailing and we continue to see tremendous demand for the incredible experiences we offer at sea. We are thrilled to be launching a new ship, the Disney Wish in June of 2022 and will welcome her sister ships to the fleet in 2024 and 2025. Combined, these 3 vessels will help increase capacity and our footprint in a business that has historically generated a double-digit return on investment, driven by a premium price might well above the industry average. Before leaving our Parks and Experiences, I want to mention the continued transformation of our Consumer Products business. We have almost completed the reduction of our physical footprint, which will enable us to pivot our approach with a focus on our e-commerce platform, shopDisney, and on more compelling retail partnerships, such as Disney Store at Target, which will triple its locations by the end of the year.  In short, our parks around the globe now have more to offer guests than ever before, with our new offerings and we're making it even easier for them to have the best time imaginable, tailored specifically to their individual needs and preferences in a way, only Disney can. Our Company is truly unique and that we have a significant presence in the physical world through our parks and resorts, as well as media entertainment assets in the digital world. And it is incredible to see how our use of our emerging technology and insights gained through our innumerable consumer touch points, is enabling us to transform the way people interact with and experience our stories and products in both worlds. The Walt Disney Company has a long track record as an early adopter in the use of technology to enhance the entertainment experience.  Steamboat Willie, the first cartoon with synchronize sound, our groundbreaking development and use of Audio-Animatronics, we were the first to distribute downloaded content on the new Apple iPod back in 2005, Pixar has been a pioneer in computer animation, these are just a few examples. Suffice it to say, our efforts to-date are merely a prologue to a time when we'll be able to connect the physical and digital worlds even more closely, allowing for storytelling without boundaries in our own Disney metaverse. And we look forward to creating unparalleled opportunities for consumers to experience everything Disney has to offer across our products and platforms wherever the consumer may be. As we look ahead to this next frontier, given our unique combination of brands, franchises, physical and digital experiences, and global reach, we see limitless potential, and that makes as excited as ever about The Walt Disney Company's next 100 years. With that, I'll turn it over to Christine, and she'll talk in greater detail about the quarter and the year ahead. Thank you, Bob. And good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the fourth fiscal quarter was $0.37, an increase of $0.57 from the prior year quarter. For the full fiscal 2021 year, diluted EPS excluding certain items was $2.29, or an increase of $0.27 versus the prior year. As a reminder, these results take into account", "doc_id": "df54a214-cda7-4b30-be8b-5052eba751e4", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "479b14a061862cd3c5213f89e35a539f7714015e1a039f3a258addfdc85d2fc6", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 344395, "end": 348654, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "98a4418c-3f4b-4bac-a026-9e259ff0fd65", "3": "5d36e18f-cf45-49a3-bd17-991400e6eecd"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "5d36e18f-cf45-49a3-bd17-991400e6eecd": {"__data__": {"text": "versus the prior year. As a reminder, these results take into account that fiscal 2020 was a 53-week year compared to our usual 52-week year in 2021. We estimate that the additional week in 2020 resulted in a benefit to pre -tax income of approximately $200 million, primarily at the Media and Entertainment Distribution segment, creating an unfavorable comparison for fiscal year '21. I'll now turn to our results in the quarter by segment, beginning with Parks, Experiences, and Products where fourth quarter operating income increased by $1.6 billion year-over-year. A profitable fourth quarter at Parks and Experiences reflects our ongoing recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.  All of our sites were open for the entire quarter, although generally at reduced capacities. In the prior-year quarter, Shanghai Disney Resort was open for the entire quarter, while Disney World Resort and Disneyland Paris were open for approximately 12 weeks. Hong Kong Disneyland Resort was open for approximately 4 weeks. And Disneyland Resort was closed for the entire quarter. Attendance trends continued to strengthen at our domestic parks, with Walt Disney World Q4 attendance up double-digits versus Q3, and Disneyland attendance continuing to strengthen significantly from its reopening in the third quarter. Guest spending at our domestic parks also continued its strong trend, with per cap in the fourth quarter up nearly 30% versus fiscal 2019.  Our forward-looking demand pipeline for domestic guests at Walt Disney World and Disneyland Resort remains strong, demonstrating our brand strength, as well as more normalized consumer behavior. Additionally, we're looking forward to the return of international attendance at our domestic parks and resorts. However, keep in mind that due to longer vacation planning lead times, we don't expect to see a substantial recovery in international attendance at our domestic parks until towards the end of fiscal 2022. At our cruise line business, as Bob mentioned earlier, our entire fleet has returned to sea with guest ratings as strong as pre -pandemic levels despite new health and safety protocols. While we expect social distancing restrictions on our ships to remain in place for at least the first half of fiscal 2022, booked occupancy on our ships for the second half of the year is already ahead of historical ranges at significantly higher pricing.  And we are excited for the Disney Wish to set sail in June 2022, with the inaugural season already nearly 90% booked. At consumer products, year-over-year operating results declined in the fourth quarter, impacted by a tough comparison in our games business due to the prior year performance of 2 titles, Marvel's Avengers and Twisted Wonderland. Turning to our Media and Entertainment Distribution segment, fourth quarter operating income decreased by approximately $600 million versus the prior year driven by lower results at Linear Networks, Direct-to-Consumer and content sales, licensing, and other. At Linear Networks, you may recall that we guided to a decline in Q4 operating income versus prior year. Operating results at Linear Networks did decrease year-over-year by approximately $200 million driven by a decrease at our domestic channels, partially offset by an improvement at our international channels. At our domestic channels, both broadcasting and cable operating income decreased in the fourth quarter versus the prior year.  Lower results of broadcasting were driven by lower results at ABC and the owned television stations. At ABC, the decrease was primarily driven by higher marketing and programming and production costs, reflecting a higher number of series versus the prior year due to last year's production delays as we noted in the guidance we gave last quarter, partially offset by higher affiliate revenue. The decrease at the owned television stations was due to lower advertising revenue, reflecting comparisons to the 53rd week and stronger political advertising in the prior year. At Cable, the year-over-year decrease in operating income was primarily driven by 3 factors. 1. Lower affiliate revenue, primarily driven by the prior-year benefit of the 53rd week. 2. An increase", "doc_id": "5d36e18f-cf45-49a3-bd17-991400e6eecd", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "da69e9199bac32495b66d19b27592d864d57c1f96a0491037ee47ce2eaf05ffd", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 348663, "end": 352872, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "df54a214-cda7-4b30-be8b-5052eba751e4", "3": "ba13e8fb-ca9a-4166-8fb4-9679420672ea"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "ba13e8fb-ca9a-4166-8fb4-9679420672ea": {"__data__": {"text": "driven by the prior-year benefit of the 53rd week. 2. An increase in marketing cost for more titles premiering in the current quarter, which we also discussed last quarter.  And finally, to a lesser extent, lower advertising revenue. These impacts were partially offset by lower programming and production costs, which generally reflect COVID-19 related timing impacts from the prior year. Cost decreased for the NBA and MLB programming versus the prior year, partially offset by increased cost for college football games. Domestic Linear Networks advertising revenue decreased in Q4 versus the prior year, driven by our Cable networks and owned television stations. Both of which were impacted by the prior-year benefit of the 53rd week. ESPN advertising revenue in the fourth quarter was comparable to the prior year, as higher rates were offset by the prior-year benefit of the 53rd week. First quarter to date, domestic cash advertising revenue at ESPN is currently pacing above the prior year, benefiting from increased ratings for college football and the NFL. Total domestic affiliate revenue decreased by 6% in the quarter.  This was driven by a benefit of 6 points of growth from higher rates, offset by a 7 point decline due to the 53rd week adjustment and a 3 point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. International channel results increased versus the prior year driven by lower programming and production costs and higher advertising revenue, partially offset by lower affiliate revenue. At Direct-to-Consumer, our fourth quarter operating results decreased by $256 million year-over-year, driven by higher losses at Disney+ and ESPN+, partially offset by improved results at Hulu. At Disney+, the higher loss versus the prior-year quarter was driven by higher programming, marketing, and technology costs. These higher costs were partially offset by increases in Subscription and Premier Access revenue.  Higher Subscription revenue reflects subscriber growth, and increases in retail pricing. And the increases in costs reflect the ongoing expansion of Disney+. Higher Premier Access revenue was driven by Black Widow and Jungle Cruise in Q4 compared to Mulan in the prior-year quarter. As Bob mentioned earlier, we ended the fourth quarter and the fiscal year with over 118 million global paid Disney+ subscribers, reflecting over 2 million net additions from Q3 in line with the subscriber guidance we gave in September. Subscribers across our domestic and core international markets, excluding Disney+ Hotstar grew by almost 4 million from Q3 to Q4. Disney+ Hotstar subs decreased versus the prior quarter and accounted for about 37% of our total Disney+ paid subscriber base as of the end of the fourth quarter. Disney+ 's global ARPU in the fourth quarter was $4.12.  Excluding Disney+ Hotstar, it was $6.24 or an increase of about $0.12 versus the third quarter continuing to benefit from recent price increases. At ESPN+ where we ended the fourth quarter with over 17 million subscribers versus nearly 15 million in Q3, the decrease in operating results year-over-year was driven by higher marketing and sports programming costs, partially offset by subscription revenue growth. And at Hulu, higher operating results in the fourth quarter versus the prior year were due to subscription revenue growth, and higher advertising revenue, partially offset by increases in programming, and to a lesser extent, marketing costs. Hulu ended the fourth quarter with 43.8 million paid subscribers, inclusive of the Hulu Live digital MVPD service.  Hulu Live subscribers increased to 4 million from 3.7 million at the end of the third quarter. Moving on to Content Sales, Licensing, and Other, results decreased in the fourth quarter versus the prior year to an operating loss of $65 million, driven by lower theatrical and TV/SVOD distribution results, both of which we noted as drivers in the guidance we gave during the last earnings call. While theaters have generally reopened, we are still experiencing a prolonged and gradual pace of recovery in this business. Lower theatrical results were driven by higher operating losses from more titles and release, as well as higher marketing expenses for future releases.

To conclude, as we progress into fiscal 2022 and beyond, there are a number of items I would like to mention. Our capital expenditures in fiscal 2021 were $3.6 billion or approximately $400 million lower than our fiscal 2020 CapEx of $4 billion. CapEx for the year came in lower than the previous guidance we gave primarily due to spending delays across the enterprise. For fiscal 2022, we expect CapEx to increase by $2.5 billion versus 2021, driven by the delivery of the Disney Wish, as well as other increased spending at DPEP incorporate. At DPEP, we expect that per cap spending at our domestic Parks in fiscal 2022 will continue to significantly exceed pre -pandemic levels, and we are particularly encouraged by the early response we are seeing to Genie at Walt Disney World. However, we also expect that while we continue to pursue strong cost mitigation efforts, certain costs will be elevated in fiscal '22 versus pre -pandemic levels, including for example, inflationary pressure on wages, costs related to new projects and initiatives such as  Galaxy's Edge, Avengers Campus, and the EPCOT expansion and a ramp up of expenses in support of our cruise ship expansion.  And as we think about fiscal '22 results at DMED, there are few things worth noting. First, we are excited about the 9 theatrical releases we have slated for the first quarter of fiscal '22. However, we expect that the prolonged recovery we're seeing in the theatrical market, paired with the marketing costs associated with each release may adversely impact theatrical operating results in the first quarter by approximately $300 million versus the prior-year quarter, which had only 2 releases. At Linear Networks, we expect that first quarter operating income will decrease by nearly $500 million versus the prior year. Reflecting factors including higher contractual sports rights costs for college football and the NFL. Timing of cricket expenses at Star India  an adverse comparison to the prior year's political advertising revenue.  Finally as it relates to our expectations for Disney+. Looking at fiscal '22, we are thrilled about the quality of the content coming in the first 3 quarters of the year. But we will not yet be at our anticipated steady-state cadence of content releases. The fourth quarter will likely be more indicative of what our slate could look like once we have  content flowing steadily from all of our industry-leading creative engines. Q4 will be the first time in Disney+ history that we plan to release original content throughout the quarter from Disney, Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, and Nat Geo all in one quarter. This include highly anticipated titles such as Ms. Marvel, Andor, and Pinocchio. And as Bob mentioned earlier, we are also increasing our local content offerings in Asia, India, Europe, and Latin America in fiscal 2022, with the majority of those titles also releasing in the back part of the year.  As we've discussed before, we don't anticipate that sub-growth will necessarily be linear from quarter-to-quarter. So putting this all together and also taking into consideration the timing of our planned international launches in 2022, we expect Disney+ subscriber net adds in the second half of fiscal 2022 will be meaningfully higher than the first half of the year. Additionally, we now expect the Disney+ will reach its peak year of losses in fiscal 2022 instead of in fiscal 2021, as better-than-expected revenue and lower content expenses due to production delays contributed to lower-than-expected losses in 2021. As Bob mentioned, we are increasing our overall long-term content expense for Disney+. And we believe we are well-positioned to achieve the subscriber target of 230 million to 260 million by fiscal 2024 that we", "doc_id": "a72e5623-56d1-4381-9fc5-512fbc0ef45e", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "f03ca18b007b3ed360d18450093e825d21964ac7b7ae8087870cc090ebe7dde1", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 357098, "end": 361256, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "de9c24bb-e4d7-4c54-a3ec-3a96bce17cac", "2": "ba13e8fb-ca9a-4166-8fb4-9679420672ea", "3": "22fe731b-575a-4afa-8e16-7f7c6c78fb13"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "22fe731b-575a-4afa-8e16-7f7c6c78fb13": {"__data__": {"text": "achieve the subscriber target of 230 million to 260 million by fiscal 2024 that we laid out at last year's Investor Day. And we also remain confident in our expectations that Disney+ will achieve profitability in fiscal 2024. And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Tammy, and we would be happy to take your questions. Thanks, Christine. As we transition to the Q&A, let me know that since we are not physically together this afternoon, I will do my best to moderate the Q&A by directing your questions to the appropriate executive. And with that Jonathan, we're ready for the first question. Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please? Thanks. Good afternoon. Bob or -- and/or Christine. I think there's 2 areas where expectations have probably been out of line with reality this year, that's a  on the stock. One of them is the Disney+ net adds, the other is probably more recently on Parks margins and you talked a lot about both of those in your prepared remarks. But maybe you could just spend a minute, on both topics. On Disney+, it sounds like we should think about net-adds being higher in 23 and 24 than in 22 based on the surge that I think you mentioned, Bob, on the programming side. So I'm wondering if you could help us with that. I think that would help set the expectations in the right spot. And then on the Parks front. Bob, you talked a lot about Parks margins, when you get back to prior peak revenues being at or maybe even higher than before, but obviously there is also not a linear ramp on the margin front either. So if you could talk a little bit about how expenses come back into the business over the course of time as it recovers relative to revenue, so we make sure we're thinking about that business the right way in this set of unusual circumstance coming out of a pandemic. Thank you. Bob, why don't you start off with Disney+ net ads, and Parks as well. And then Christine, maybe you can chime in on the expenses for Parks? Okay. Thank you, Ben. On the Disney+ side, as Christine had said, we're real pleased with where we're sitting. But again, it's not going to be a linear rate quarter to quarter. I think the recovery that you mentioned in terms of getting the growth rate back up to where it's been historically, is really going to come in the third and the fourth quarters. The third quarter will be powered, not necessarily by the content, but by the number of ads that we have in terms of markets. Our number of markets that we're going to add will essentially double to more than 160 by FY2023, and that will propel us in the third quarter. And the fourth quarter will be more of a function of that. Finally, the dam will break in terms of the content that we announced last December that will be substantial, and will lead to a cadence of content throughout the quarter that will look more like what we expect to see from an ongoing standpoint.  Obviously, we're only in year 2 of the Disney+ launch, and the hunger for content, for the service is extraordinary. And when you have that happen at the same time that you have a pandemic, and you have to shut down production. That's not a good combination. And yet we identified the need for the content way-back exactly a year ago, and have prepared a very strong cadence of content which will now hit the pipeline in the second half of this year. In terms of the park situation, we are very bullish. We're seeing incredible 30% increases in per caps, as I think was referenced in the earnings letter. And so we're not only seeing strong demand, but it's at per caps that are much higher than we've traditionally seen.  There was a reference and I am not sure if everyone appreciates the gravity of this to the Genie+ success, 1/3 of our guests at Walt Disney World, are buying the Genie+ upgrade at $15, that's per guest, per day. And that is a very, very material increase for in per-caps, but also in margins. So we're very bullish about both our Disney+ business, both in terms of  of guidance that has been given today.

Christine? Thanks, Bob. And thanks, Ben. I'm glad you asked the question on Parks expenses. And I know you know this business well, but just for the benefit of some others that maybe newer to following Disney. Let's remember that the Parks expenses are in 3 buckets, fixed, which is quite substantial, semi-fixed, and variable. So variable was where we were really able to make some adjustments during COVID. But the other fixed and semi-fixed buckets are ones that we have to carry on regardless of the operating environment that we found ourselves in.

At the request of LyondellBasell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. . I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Thank you, Alex. Before we begin the discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com/investorrelations.  Today, we will be discussing our business results while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risk and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that could lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our regulatory filings, which are also available at our Investor Relations website.  Additional documents on our Investor website provide reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with other disclosures, including the earnings release and our business results discussion.  A recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1 p.m. Eastern Time today until May 29 by calling 877-660-6853 in the United States and 201-612-7415 outside the United States. The access code for both numbers is 13727006.  During today's call, we will focus on first quarter results, the current market and our near-term outlook.  Before turning the call over to Ken, I would like to call your attention to the noncash lower of cost or market inventory adjustments, or LCM, in the impairments that we have discussed on past calls. LCM adjustments are related to our use of last in, first out or LIFO accounting and the volatility in prices for our raw materials and finished goods inventories. Impairment charges were recognized to write down assets to their estimated fair value. Impairments include the noncash impairment of $624 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 that reflects our evaluation of strategic options for the Houston refinery.  Comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of impairments and LCM inventory adjustments.  With that being said, I now would like to turn the call over to Ken. Thank you, Dave, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our first quarter 2022 results. Today's teleconference marks my second earnings call as the interim CEO of LyondellBasell. And I would like to thank our Board of Directors for the opportunity to lead the company over the past few months. Our incoming CEO, Peter Vanacker, joined our Board on February 25, and we're looking forward to him assuming his role as Chief Executive Officer on May 23. Peter and I have been talking over the past several months to ensure a smooth transition and a successful start to his leadership of our company. I know that Peter is very eager to engage with our employees, customers, investors and suppliers to help us build upon the momentum we have underway in LyondellBasell.  Before we get into the results, I would like to take a moment to address the tragic and unprovoked attacks unfolding in Ukraine. My heart breaks seeing so many people devastated and the resulting humanitarian crisis. At LyondellBasell, we are working to address the impacts of this crisis through our global corporate citizenship program, Advancing Good. The company and our employees have collectively donated more than $600,000 to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Medical Corp.  LyondellBasell's presence in Russia and Ukraine is fairly limited. Less than 0.3% of our 2021 revenue came from Russia and a negligible amount from Ukraine. In March, we announced that LyondellBasell will not enter into any new business transactions or relationships with Russian state-owned entities. We also intend to discontinue business relationships with those companies to the extent legally possible.  Of course, we are also complying with", "doc_id": "8c74de65-ced8-4ca4-ade3-979067dc028e", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "b1a4e9d49e8825f090969045b5dc2e723bf7100dc5ad067b2996cd6467e550fb", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 4314, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96714939-cfe7-4621-b6aa-94fae9289ebf", "3": "f50e0896-f5ab-42fc-9f53-6c3ea0b44b33"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "f50e0896-f5ab-42fc-9f53-6c3ea0b44b33": {"__data__": {"text": "to the extent legally possible.  Of course, we are also complying with all U.S. and international sanctions. While we have no manufacturing sites in Russia or Ukraine, we do have about 30 employees working in offices in Russia. Last week, we made the difficult decision to cease operations at our Moscow and Togliati offices. We have a local team in place to support our employees during this transition period.  At LyondellBasell, we believe in the power of many, and we hope many of you find ways to support the Ukrainian people and influence peace and stability across Europe.  Now let's review our first quarter results, starting with Slide 3. LyondellBasell's businesses are continuing to benefit from solid global demand and improving markets for products from our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. During the first quarter, LyondellBasell generated $4 per share of earnings, $2 billion of EBITDA and $1.5 billion of cash from operating activities.  The start of the year is typically a seasonally slow period for the petrochemical industry. 2022 marks the first time since 2015 where LyondellBasell earned $2 billion of EBITDA during the first quarter, and our income of $4 per share establishes a new first quarter earnings per share record for the company. Despite a turbulent backdrop of geopolitical uncertainties, ongoing supply chain challenges, and volatile prices for energy and feedstocks, LyondellBasell is off to a great start in 2022.  Let's turn to Slide 4 and review our safety performance. LyondellBasell's commitment to safety leadership remains a consistent and unwavering component of our company's culture. In 2022, our year-to-date total recordable incident rate for employees and contractors has improved by more than 40% to 0.12. This year, we are emphasizing the importance of instilling safety-related touch points during interactions that occur naturally throughout the workday at our facilities. Whether it's planned or spontaneous, these daily touch points provide powerful opportunities to convey authentic and impactful leadership related to safety performance. This personalized approach to safety improvement is yielding results.  During March, we had only 1 recordable injury across our global workforce of more than 19,000 employees. This represents substantial progress toward our ultimate goal of 0 injuries, and I want to thank all of our employees for their commitment to our Goal Zero journey.  On Slide 5, we highlight the recent publication of the fifth edition of our annual sustainability report. This year's report updates our progress to our goals that help in addressing climate change, ending plastic waste and supporting a thriving society.  The cover graphic from the report highlights our focus on 2030 interim targets that track our progress toward longer-term goals. Last September, we accelerated these targets and set a goal to achieve net zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions from our global operations by 2050. Our interim 2030 target is to reduce absolute emissions from our global operations by 30% relative to a 2020 baseline. In the area of circular plastics, our 2030 goal is to produce a meaningful share of our polymer production, 2 million tons per year from recycled and renewable based feedstocks.  And this year, we announced new targets supporting our diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Our goals are to achieve gender parity across our global senior leadership and increase the number of underrepresented groups in our U.S. senior leadership to reflect the general population within 10 years.  Please turn to Slide 6, where we highlight some of our recent collaborations to develop more sustainable products. First, we've collaborated with Nippon Paint to produce packaging for the Chinese market using LyondellBasell's mechanically recycled CirculenRecover polypropylene. The paint containers reuse post-consumer plastic waste and reduce reliance on fossil-based feedstocks.  Next, we show an example of the polyethylene tubes that we developed with our customer, Albea for L'Occitane shower scrub. The caps and tubes are designed to be fully recyclable and made with LyondellBasell's CirculenRevive polymers that are", "doc_id": "f50e0896-f5ab-42fc-9f53-6c3ea0b44b33", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "cb79fd9ea80e65d476cd4d0aaa321e93de7106bee1dd3ba9292e241049720101", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 4257, "end": 8478, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96714939-cfe7-4621-b6aa-94fae9289ebf", "2": "8c74de65-ced8-4ca4-ade3-979067dc028e", "3": "e7ec507b-fadf-4d9c-9484-405019a8c146"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "e7ec507b-fadf-4d9c-9484-405019a8c146": {"__data__": {"text": "and made with LyondellBasell's CirculenRevive polymers that are produced from an advanced molecular recycling process using plastic waste. The redesigned tubes retain the iconic brand's look and feel while providing a new life for plastic waste and reducing consumption of fossil-based feedstocks.  Finally, we collaborated with several customers to develop clear polypropylene drink cups for McDonald's from our CirculenRenew polymers using renewable feedstocks produced by Neste from bio-based sources such as McDonald's used cooking oil. We also have a similar collaboration underway with CirculenRevive to make cups for Wendy's restaurants. Wendy's estimates that their couple will divert 10 million pounds of plastic waste from landfills over the first 2 years.  LyondellBasell's collaborations on sustainability extend both up and down the supply chain. In Houston, we helped form the Houston recycling collaboration to increase recycling rates and improve the availability of feedstock from plastic waste. And through our investment with closed loop partners, we have invested in material recovery facilities that support post-consumer plastic waste recycling in New York, New Jersey and Florida.  Also, we are making good progress in decarbonizing our electrical power consumption by eliminating coal at our Wesseling, Germany facility and establishing renewable power purchase agreements with partners.  In addition, we are collaborating with several peers on the development of large-scale carbon capture and storage facilities for the Houston region that would help decarbonize our industry.  Notably, we want to acknowledge our decision to exit the refining business by the end of 2023. This was a difficult decision, but we determined that an exit is likely to provide the best outcome for the company. We will talk more about this decision later in this call. Nonetheless, on the sustainability front, the shutdown of the refinery is expected to reduce LyondellBasell's Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 15%.  Our strategy is to both leverage LyondellBasell's proprietary technology and collaborate with capable partners to advance our progress on circular plastics and decarbonization initiatives.  Please turn to Slide 7 to review our quarterly profitability. During the first quarter, our business portfolio delivered over $2 billion of EBITDA, similar to fourth quarter results. Despite volatile prices for energy and feedstocks, solid product demand supported margins for our products across most markets in Europe and the Americas. Supply disruptions triggered by the war in Ukraine and the COVID pandemic created headwinds during the quarter.  While we remain watchful for signs of demand destruction from inflation, we have been largely successful in passing through higher energy and feedstock costs in the prices of our products.  We expect the strict 0 COVID policies in China will continue to hinder growth and profitability in Asia during the second quarter.  At LyondellBasell, our oxyfuels and refining businesses are benefiting from increased demand for transportation fuels as in-person activities resume and global travel recovers. We expect that favorable markets for transportation fuels will continue through next year.  Slide 8 depicts LyondellBasell's historical profitability. Over the course of the first complete business cycle for our company, we delivered an average of $6.7 billion of EBITDA. In today's strong market and with LyondellBasell's larger asset base, we delivered $9.7 billion of EBITDA over the last 12 months, nearly 45% above the prior cycle average.  LyondellBasell's earnings performance is clearly stepping up from prior business cycles. We are well positioned with a diversified portfolio and larger asset base with propylene oxide and oxyfuels growth underway to extend this performance into the next cycle.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael, who will describe our financial and segment results in more detail. Thank you, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 9, and let me begin by extending the stepping-up theme to the substantial cash generation from our businesses.  In the first quarter, LyondellBasell generated $1.5 billion of cash", "doc_id": "e7ec507b-fadf-4d9c-9484-405019a8c146", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "185a487cb79c8c53ee78485aea3330a5de5ef4f118366111caaebbe5ffde970f", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 8481, "end": 12727, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96714939-cfe7-4621-b6aa-94fae9289ebf", "2": "f50e0896-f5ab-42fc-9f53-6c3ea0b44b33", "3": "6ec4a7a2-aaae-4df7-a717-824e30e7c3fc"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "6ec4a7a2-aaae-4df7-a717-824e30e7c3fc": {"__data__": {"text": " In the first quarter, LyondellBasell generated $1.5 billion of cash from operating activities that contributed toward a new record of $8.6 billion in cash from operations over the last 12 months. During the past 4 quarters, our team efficiently converted 88% of our EBITDA into cash. After accounting for sustaining capital reinvested in the business, we achieved a free operating cash flow yield of 23% relative to our market capitalization over the last 12 months.  The LyondellBasell team is highly focused on extending our proven track record of efficient cash generation to provide prudent reinvestment in our company and generous returns for our shareholders.  Let's continue with Slide 10 and review the details of our cash generation and allocation during the first quarter. With $1.5 billion of cash from operating activities, we funded our dividends and capital investments for the first quarter while continuing to repurchase shares and building some cash on the balance sheet. During the first quarter, we returned nearly $600 million to shareholders through our dividend and the repurchase of approximately 2.1 million shares. We continue to invest in maintenance and growth projects with more than $400 million in capital expenditures. This includes our new world-scale PO/TBA plant starting up later this year.  We ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of cash and short-term investments and $5.9 billion of cash and available liquidity. With our total debt at 1.2x trailing EBITDA, our leverage ratios are below our targeted range of 1.5 to 2.5, and we see no need for further deleveraging at this time.  Now I'd like to provide an overview of the results for each of our segments on Slide 11. As Ken mentioned, LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered over $2 billion of EBITDA during the first quarter. Our results reflect solid demand for our products and improving market conditions, benefiting our I&D and APS segments, offset by higher feedstock costs that compressed margins in our O&P-Americas segment.  Let's begin the individual segment discussions on Slide 12 with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment. First quarter 2022 EBITDA was $911 million, $351 million lower than the fourth quarter 2021. Olefin results decreased approximately $170 million compared to the fourth quarter with lower margins due to higher feedstock costs and lower pricing for propylene and butadiene coproducts. We completed planned cracker maintenance at our La Porte, Texas site that contributed to lower volumes and resulted in our North America crackers operating at a rate of 82% during the quarter. Polyolefins results decreased approximately $185 million during the first quarter due to compressed margins driven by lower product prices and higher monomer costs. Stable demand led to relatively comparable volumes despite ongoing logistics and raw material challenges.  In March, we achieved an increase in polyethylene contract prices to reverse fourth quarter trends of declining prices. We continue to see strong demand for our polymers as we head into the second quarter. We expect margin recovery as product prices rise reflect higher energy and feedstock costs and stronger summer demand tightens markets.  Now please turn to Slide 13 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia International segment. Higher product prices and volumes offset rising cost in EAI markets, resulting in first quarter EBITDA of $188 million, $33 million higher than the fourth quarter. Prior quarter results were impacted by LIFO inventory valuation charges of approximately $30 million. Olefins results increased about $25 million as margins improved driven by increased monomer prices that offset higher feedstock and energy cost. We operated our European crackers at a rate of 74% of capacity due to planned maintenance and feedstock supply disruptions resulting from the war in Ukraine. Combined polyolefin results increased approximately $35 million compared to the prior quarter. Stable demand drove increased polyolefin price spreads and volumes despite higher energy and monomer cost. Historically low Asian polyolefin spreads and weaker volumes, driven by COVID-related lockdowns in China caused our joint venture equity income to decline by about $50 million. During the second quarter, we expect that volumes and integrated margins for the", "doc_id": "6ec4a7a2-aaae-4df7-a717-824e30e7c3fc", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "4336839e2952721951611c47668fec15b752a25be914cb2d7c34b606a25941f2", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 12726, "end": 17127, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96714939-cfe7-4621-b6aa-94fae9289ebf", "2": "e7ec507b-fadf-4d9c-9484-405019a8c146", "3": "c69c08f4-2bf2-496f-ac9c-4e12e4a408bd"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "c69c08f4-2bf2-496f-ac9c-4e12e4a408bd": {"__data__": {"text": "million. During the second quarter, we expect that volumes and integrated margins for the segment will be comparable to the first quarter as steady demand should support price increases and keep pace with increasing costs.  On April 13, we reached an agreement to sell our Australian polypropylene business to Veeva Energy. We expect a second quarter noncash asset impairment charge of approximately $70 million in the O&P EAI segment related to the sale of this business.  Last quarter, we provided guidance related to planned maintenance at our cracker in Berre, France. Due to additional work we now think this turnaround will impact second quarter EBITDA by about $50 million. As high inflation begins to trigger concerns about the potential for recession, it is instructive to review the resilience of polyethylene demand growth over the past 30 years.  In Slide 14, the chart depicts the strength of polyethylene demand relative to other markets through the last 4 U.S. recessions. As indicated by the turquoise line, PE demand is remarkably resilient and compounds at a fairly consistent rate of about 4%, meaningfully higher than typical GDP. Unlike U.S. housing and vehicle markets, PE demand is relatively inelastic and embedded in essential products for our modern lives. Polyethylene is a foundational building block for consumer staples with wide-ranging applications such as food packaging, daily hygiene supplies and health care products. And with a cost advantage from shale feedstocks, U.S. polyethylene production increasingly serves a global market. We expect these resilient growth trends will continue as more people in emerging markets gain purchasing power and increased consumption of these essential products for modern life.  Please turn to Slide 15 as we take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Robust margin expansion in most businesses resulted in record first quarter EBITDA of $546 million, $294 million above the prior quarter. Prior quarter results were impacted by LIFO inventory valuation charges of approximately $95 million. First quarter propylene oxide and derivative results increased $50 million as butane dial and other derivative margins expanded. Durable goods demand remained solid, resulting in comparable volumes for the quarter.  Intermediate chemicals results increased more than $30 million. Margins increased in most businesses, primarily styrene and acetyls driven by tight market supply. Volumes increased as a result of improved first quarter operations. Oxyfuels and related products results increased more than $125 million as margins improved on higher gasoline prices and moderation in the ratio of butane feedstock prices relative to crude oil. Prior to the pandemic, our oxyfuels business was a fairly reliable contributor to the profitability of our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. With gasoline demand approaching pre-pandemic levels, we expect a return to typical performance for the oxyfuels business in 2022.  In the second quarter, we expect volumes to increase with seasonal strength in demand for durable goods from building and construction markets. Margins for oxyfuels and related products are expected to expand with typical seasonal reductions in butane feedstock costs and increased gasoline demand associated with summer travel. Planned maintenance at our butane dial facility in 1 of our 2 propylene oxide units located at our Channelview, Texas site is expected to impact second quarter EBITDA for Intermediates and Derivatives segment by approximately $80 million.  Over the past 2 weeks, we declared force majeure for several acetyl products due to equipment failure at our La Porte, Texas site. If we are successful in restarting acetyls production during May, we are currently estimating a second quarter EBITDA impact for the downtime of approximately $50 million.  Now let's move forward and review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 16. Improving volumes from automotive production and higher margins resulted in first quarter EBITDA of $125 million, $101 million higher than the fourth quarter. Prior quarter results were impacted by LIFO inventory valuation charges of approximately $55 million.  Compounding and solutions results increased $40 million. Volumes increased due to improved demand from automotive parts manufacturers relative to the fourth quarter. Margins increased through stronger product pricing", "doc_id": "c69c08f4-2bf2-496f-ac9c-4e12e4a408bd", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "e87269fd87b51e67060b72f78143fed049edd301dd552d6b181c9eba7c4cacdf", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 17110, "end": 21562, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96714939-cfe7-4621-b6aa-94fae9289ebf", "2": "6ec4a7a2-aaae-4df7-a717-824e30e7c3fc", "3": "35fc37c0-9383-4a90-97bd-c0298b359e4f"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "35fc37c0-9383-4a90-97bd-c0298b359e4f": {"__data__": {"text": "parts manufacturers relative to the fourth quarter. Margins increased through stronger product pricing and improving asset utilization, partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs. Advanced results increased $10 million, driven by increased seasonal roofing demand for Catalloy and higher product prices. We expect results will be similar in the second quarter as automotive recovery continues to drive volumes while rising cost impact margins. The latest IHS production forecast predicts a 4% rise in 2022 global automotive builds and a 9% increase in 2023. Unfortunately, these reduced forecast delay a return to prior peak production levels until 2025.  Now please turn to Slide 17 and discuss the results of our Refining segment. Our first quarter EBITDA was $148 million, a decrease of $2 million. Prior quarter results benefited from LIFO inventory valuation changes of approximately $50 million. In the first quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 benchmark expanded significantly to $30.82 per barrel, a $7.24 increase due to higher demand for gasoline and diesel partially offset by lower byproduct value. We operated the refinery at 95% of nameplate capacity with an average crude throughput of 255,000 barrels per day. In April, Refining margins continue to expand with increasing demand for transportation fuels. We expect refining markets will remain favorable during the summer months.  Please turn to Slide 18 as we review the results for our Technology segment. First quarter EBITDA was $103 million, $70 million lower than the prior quarter's record level. The results were driven by lower licensing revenue and higher catalyst volumes and margins. We expect that second quarter profitability for our technology business will be slightly higher than the first quarter based on the anticipated timing of licensing revenue milestones.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. Ken? Thank you, Michael. As I mentioned earlier, last week, we announced our decision to exit the crude oil refining business no later than the end of 2023. While these decisions are never easy, operation of the refinery beyond next year would require significant capital investment. After thoroughly analyzing our options, we determined that exiting the business was the best path forward.  Our intention is to safely operate the refinery at full range through the end of next year to meet strong market demand for transportation fuels. During that time, we will continue to consider potential transactions and alternatives for the site. As mentioned earlier, by exiting refining, LyondellBasell will make substantial progress in reducing the company's greenhouse gas emissions.  In addition, the refinery is located on 700 acres in the center of one of the world's leading integrated petrochemical hubs. The site's unique location provides LyondellBasell with valuable options for future growth, including further development of our circular businesses. We recognize that this decision affects our employees, their families and the community. Our employees and contractors at the refinery have delivered outstanding performance in safety, reliability, cost improvement and profitability over the past several years. We sincerely thank them for their contributions, and we are committed to supporting our people through this transition.  Now let me summarize the first quarter and our outlook with Slide 19. With all of the turbulence in the global economy, LyondellBasell's first quarter results illustrate the benefits of our global business portfolio and how demand for our products is highly resilient. While Asia is suffering from weak markets and historically low margins, demand in Europe and the Americas remains remarkably strong and consistent. Improving margins in our Intermediates and Derivatives segment offset first quarter margin compression in our O&P-Americas business. We expect PE chain margins to improve with higher seasonal demand supporting polymer price increases. Also, increased demand for transportation fuels is driving a recovery from pandemic-related weakness in our oxyfuels and Refining businesses. As a result, we expect cash generation will remain strong at LyondellBasell.  Just like our earnings, we are stepping up in our progress on sustainability. Today, we talked about a few of our collaborations with customers to develop circular and renewable products for meaningful applications.

With robust cash generation, we plan to continue rewarding shareholders through a growing dividend and share repurchases. We are consistent in our commitment to an investment-grade balance sheet and remain highly disciplined in our consideration of organic and inorganic growth investments.  The coming months are exciting times for LyondellBasell. Our businesses are generating resilient results despite volatile economic conditions. We are laying the groundwork for new, more sustainable business models that are likely to reshape value chains across our industry. And later this year, we will be starting up our new propylene oxide and oxyfuel assets during a period of robust margins and strong market demand.  Finally, on May 23, I look forward to welcoming our next CEO, Peter Vanacker, to lead LyondellBasell. I hope you share my enthusiasm about the future of our company under his leadership.  We're now pleased to take your questions. . Our first question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho. This is Kieran on for Chris. I was wondering if you could just touch a little bit more in terms of what operating rates you're expecting in O&P-Americas in 2Q and throughout the year and maybe how you see that supporting what have been announced price increases throughout the second quarter and throughout the rest of the year? Thank you for your question. We are -- as we've said during the remarks, we are still very bullish on the demand outlook, especially in the Americas. So we see demand being very strong. We had a record sales month in the month of March for polyethylene in the Americas. And we see April actually looking to improve on that. So we're -- our outlook is that we'll continue to see operating rates, effective rates probably in the 90% or higher range. So that's going to be very supportive for the price increases that are in the market today. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Polyethylene prices in China continue to fall. Maybe if you look at the month forward prices, maybe they're down $100 a ton to 13 30, something like that. What do you make of that, in that I would have thought that profitability was pretty poor even at higher prices, and there's been a movement upward in the other regions? And maybe you can also comment on the changing profitability of your Bora cracker. Jeff, thank you for your question. I hope you're doing well. Yes. So China, definitely, we've been seeing headwinds there. A lot of that related still to the COVID lockdowns. As you can imagine, the demand profile in China is quite challenging today with the amount of lockdowns that we see. Also, that's going to have an impact on some of the supply chain situation that we've seen.  So prices today have basically been moving pretty much with feedstock in China. And when you look across the industry there, you do see all of the crackers, all the operators of crackers, they are cutting back on rates. So even for us at the Bora joint venture, we've reduced rates, and we've got a first quartile asset. So we do expect that in the coming months, what's going to happen is you're going to see a reset around inventory. Inventories are not high in China by any means, and you're going to see the inventory come down. And then I expect you're going to see demand come back. That reopening impact is still to come in China. And so while yes, in the short term, we're seeing some challenges around profitability with the cracker assets in China. As I look out in the next few months, I expect that's going to reverse and you're going to see a snapback in demand. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. I have a couple of questions about your Circulen products and perhaps about the Renew, which is derived from the renewable naphtha that you get from Neste. Do you see that as challenged longer term because that feedstock is -- can go into", "doc_id": "0fe2e68b-15d8-4d07-aa77-7a501f31ddc0", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "fe5123f19ba3f3bb83d96c118e8e60416202210fb2c0d78544bb1f1fe618bfb2", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 26032, "end": 30329, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96714939-cfe7-4621-b6aa-94fae9289ebf", "2": "35fc37c0-9383-4a90-97bd-c0298b359e4f", "3": "7e673181-6836-44f1-9fbf-dfc07544321c"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "7e673181-6836-44f1-9fbf-dfc07544321c": {"__data__": {"text": "Do you see that as challenged longer term because that feedstock is -- can go into renewable diesel and get lots of credits and why not pursue kind of a carbohydrate path for that feedstocks such as ethanol-sourced ethylene? Thank you, Steve, for your question. Yes. So we're very proud of the product portfolio that we're developing. As we've said before, we're looking forward to being a leader in the area of circularity and launch of our Circulen brand globally last year, you're beginning to see the fruits of that effort in the products that we've been developing together with customers today.  In our portfolio, as we look forward, the CirculenRenew part of our portfolio will probably be the smaller segment for us. We are much more bullish on our ability to develop the advanced recycling and mechanical recycling parts of our business. Those really fit very well with our technical capabilities around developing new processes, but also the application development that we do together with our customers. So we will continue to look for opportunities to develop the CirculenRenew portfolio, where we see that and where customers are demanding lower CO2 footprint products, which is primarily why you want those CirculenRenew products. But remember, when you're doing recycling, people are driving recycled content. So there is a little bit of a different value proposition for those 2 products in the marketplace. Our next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. This is Bhavesh Lodaya for John. So in the I&D segment, clearly, very impressive results, especially in the first quarter. Now within the first quarter, a lot changed in March with the spike in crude. So could you describe or maybe break out the earnings seen in March versus the rest of the quarter? And then you mentioned that you expect oxyfuels earnings to return to more of a normalized earnings level this year. What would that new norm be? Thanks, Bhavesh, for the question. Yes. Look, Intermediates & Derivatives really had a very strong quarter, record first quarter for that segment. We did see, as the quarter progressed, especially even relative to the fourth quarter, margins recovered, strong demand pretty much across the portfolio. We got a little bit of relief on butane and the feedstock in the feed slate there. So all of those things are going to be very constructive as we go into the second quarter. Demand for all of the product lines that we have are continuing to look very good, and margins are going to continue to be above average.  So as Michael said in the prepared comments, we do believe that we're going to get those businesses back to a more normal level, but I would expect that they're go, ['Unidentified Analyst', 'Bhavesh Lodaya', 'Stephen Byrne', 'Jeffrey Zekauskas', 'Operator', 'Michael McMurray', 'Kenneth Lane', 'David Kinney']\n1, AXP, 1, 2022, 2022-04-22 10:21:04, Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the American Express Q1 2022 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.  As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Vivian Zhou. Please, go ahead. Thank you, Alan, and thank you all for joining today's call.

After that, we will move to Q&A on the results with both Steve and Jeff. With that, let me turn it over to Steve. Thanks, Vivian, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter earnings call. At our Investor Day last month, we took you through a detailed discussion of our strategies for driving sustainable growth across our businesses and explain why we are confident we can achieve our growth plan aspirations for 2024 and beyond. As we said then, our confidence is based on three interrelated factors: the success of the strategy we've been pursuing over the past several years, which focuses on investing in our brand, customers, value propositions, coverage, technology and talent to build share, scale and relevance. The momentum we've been generating through the effective execution of that strategy; and a number of structural shifts in the payment industry that are contributing to our momentum. The strong first quarter results we announced today are tracking in line with our expectations for the full year, despite the uncertain macro environment, and they reinforce our confidence in our ability to achieve our longer-term aspirations. For the quarter, revenues were $11.7 billion, up 29% year-over-year, and earnings were -- earnings per share were $2.73. These results reflect continued momentum in our core business in areas that are critical to sustainable long-term growth, including customer acquisition, engagement and retention, as well as outstanding credit performance. New proprietary card acquisitions remain at their strong pace, reaching three million this quarter, which continues to be driven by strong demand for our premium fee-based products, particularly among Millennial and Gen Z consumers, and small and medium-sized businesses in the US. We had an all-time high in acquisitions of US Consumer Platinum and Gold cards, as well as US business Platinum Cards this quarter. Delta card acquisitions reached an all-time monthly high in March, an indication of the growing demand for travel-related products and services. Regarding customer engagement, we look at a variety of indicators to measure progress. For example, Card Member engagement with our digital capabilities continues to grow with daily active users across the web and mobile, up double digits over last year. We're also seeing strong engagement with the new benefits we added to our -- recently regressed consumer Platinum card, particularly among millennial and Gen Z card members nearly half in whom have used at least one of the new travel and lifestyle benefits to-date. And we continue to see an acceleration in customer engage with our resi dining platform, including strong double-digit growth over the last quarter in a number of Amex cards on file and a number of restaurants participating in our global dining access program. March was one of resi's best months on record for reservations, up nearly 16% over February. Ultimately, the key metric to gauge customer engagement is spending growth. Overall bill business grew 35% in Q1 global year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis, and we saw our highest volumes ever in March, surpassing our previous highest of December of 2021. Spending growth was led by the acceleration of volumes from millennial and Gen Z consumers up 56% and SME is up 30% on an FX adjusted basis over last year. Goods and services spending continued to accelerate in the quarter, growing 21% on an FX adjusted basis over last year. Travel and entertainment spending was up 121% globally on an FX adjusted basis year-over-year, driven by strong growth in consumer travel spending. Customer retention remains at the very high levels I mentioned at Investor Day, an indication of the value our customers continue to place in Amex membership. A major contributor to our success across all of these areas is the ongoing expansion of many partnerships, which go well beyond our large strategic partners like Delta, Hilton and Amazon. We continue to extend relationships with a variety of companies that are adding differentiated value to our membership model. For example, last week, we announced a new financial advice service with Vanguard, exclusive for our U.S.", "doc_id": "89377f31-5cbc-46a0-a8cd-e9cadac403e5", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "d1fed6bb7cca7c77df8f0ccd57ce9357955a4a6c225617868c489cb94b0a060e", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 34543, "end": 38938, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96714939-cfe7-4621-b6aa-94fae9289ebf", "2": "7e673181-6836-44f1-9fbf-dfc07544321c", "3": "e8bcdece-e2a0-4011-8820-b1601fa8761b"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "e8bcdece-e2a0-4011-8820-b1601fa8761b": {"__data__": {"text": "we announced a new financial advice service with Vanguard, exclusive for our U.S. consumer card members, which brings together Vanguard's digital financial planning and investment management expertise with our industry-leading membership rewards. This is just the latest example of how we're expanding our value propositions beyond their traditional card offerings to meet more of our customers' financial and lifestyle needs. In addition, we're accelerating our focus on fintechs to drive more innovation, including our new partnership with i2c, which will enable fintechs to more seamlessly and quickly issue new products on the American Express network. We also continue to make progress on our ESG initiatives, which are important components of our overall business strategy because we recognize that when our customers, communities and colleagues thrive so does our company. On a diversity equity inclusion front, we are more than three quarters away towards our goal of investing $1 billion in a wide range of actions by 2024, including increasing spend with diverse suppliers, providing resources and financial assistance to minority-owned SMEs in the U.S. and maintaining pay equity across genders globally and ethnicities in the U.S. among other efforts. Our DEI progress was cited as one of the key reasons, along with our flexible work policies for our number eight ranking on Fortune's 2022 list of the Best U.S. companies to work for, which was announced last week. This is the third consecutive year we've been in the top 10, which helps us attract and retain talent. And we recently announced a series of initiatives coinciding with Earth Month that are designed to engage our customers, community partners and colleagues in our climate efforts including the goal of significantly expanding the use of recycled plastic in our card products. These initiatives build on the work we've already done and continue our efforts to reduce our own carbon footprint, including our commitment to net-zero carbon emissions by 2035. In summary, with this solid start to the year, the continued tailwinds we expect from the ongoing recovery from the pandemic, we're reaffirming our full year guidance of delivering revenue growth in the range of 18% to 20% and earnings per share of between $9.25 and $9.65. Furthermore, we remain confident that successful execution of our strategy will position us well as we seek to achieve our long-term growth plan aspirations of revenue growth in excess of 10% and mid-teens EPS growth in 2024 and beyond. I'll now turn it over to Jeff for a deeper dive on the quarter. Thank you. Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's great to be here to talk about our first quarter results, which reflect a solid start to 2022 and are tracking in line with the guidance we gave for the full year and with our aspiration to build growth momentum beyond 2022. Starting with our summary financials on slide 2. Most importantly, our first quarter revenues were $11.7 billion, up 31% on an FX-adjusted basis, consistent with the momentum we have built and our longer-term growth aspirations. Our reported first quarter net income was $2.1 billion with earnings per share of $2.73. As you know, year-over-year comparisons of net income have been challenging for the industry over the past two years due to the volatility that the pandemic has caused in credit reserve adjustments. For that reason, we thought it would be a helpful supplemental disclosure this quarter to include our pre-tax pre-provision income. That number was $2.7 billion in the first quarter, up 16% versus the comparable number in 2021, reflecting growth in our core earnings. So now let's get into a little more detailed look at our results, starting with volumes. As you can see in our slides, we have mostly gone back to reporting our volumes on a year-over-year basis, moving away from the comparisons to 2019 that we have done in recent quarters. We think that returning to a focus on year-over-year comparison gives you a better view of the momentum we have built and the momentum we are seeking to maintain as we look towards our longer term growth objectives. Starting on", "doc_id": "e8bcdece-e2a0-4011-8820-b1601fa8761b", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "a8a776694e8c72c16a8cb5078b5b0c3aa92d0b29e5290b5b8a3f57e7a1a2b9fa", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 38948, "end": 43132, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96714939-cfe7-4621-b6aa-94fae9289ebf", "2": "89377f31-5cbc-46a0-a8cd-e9cadac403e5", "3": "d3c3cfd3-6aff-4901-908f-7c67de2f064c"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "d3c3cfd3-6aff-4901-908f-7c67de2f064c": {"__data__": {"text": "seeking to maintain as we look towards our longer term growth objectives. Starting on slide 3. Total network volumes and build business were both up over 30% year-over-year in the first quarter on an FX adjusted basis, strengthening further from the strong growth rates seen in the past few quarters. And as Steve highlighted, intra-quarter, while Omicron slowed growth in January and early February, we then saw a strong acceleration in March, with that month achieving our highest ever level of monthly build business. And I would point out that the majority of this high level of growth was driven by the momentum we have built and the number of transactions flowing through our network with only a modest impact from inflation. Now as I talked about at our Investor Day last month and as slide 4 reiterates, the majority of our build business is spending on goods and services from our consumer and small and medium sized enterprise customers. And as you can see on slide 5, business service spending remained robust in the first quarter with year-over-year growth reaching 21%, slightly above the 2021 exit rate. This momentum is from strong growth in online and card not present spending that continued in the first quarter even as offline spending growth strengthened, demonstrating the effect of the structural shift in online commerce that we've seen accelerated by the pandemic. And while T&E spending is a smaller portion of our total billings, you see on slide 6 that it is now strongly supporting our growth momentum, with overall T&E spending growing 121% year-over-year. T&E spending did show a dip in January and early February due to the Omicron variant, but spending rebounded tremendously, reflecting pent-up travel demand and essentially reached 2019 levels for the first time since the start of the pandemic in the month of March. And this kind of T&E spending growth has continued right into early April. When you then break these spending trends down across our consumer and commercial businesses, as we begin to do on slide 7, there are a few other key points I'd suggest you take fully. First, our millennial and Gen Z customers continue to drive our highest consumer growth with their spending up 56% year-over-year and spending growth from all other age cohorts increasing as well in the quarter. Also of note, global consumer T&E volumes overall were back above 2019 levels as of the first quarter, led by the growth in the US. Second, our commercial businesses strategic focus on helping SME clients run their businesses continues to drive strong growth in overall SME spending, up 30% in the first quarter with acceleration in growth across both the US and international. While a smaller part of our overall growth is in this segment, I would point out that our large and global corporate clients have begun to show signs of business travel recovery, especially in the latter part of the quarter with a year-over-year growth rate for the quarter of 42%. So overall, we are pleased with the growth momentum we see across the board in our spending volumes, which is tracking in line with our expectations for both the year and for our long-term expectations. As you then move to receivable and loan balances on slide 9, you see that our growth momentum has brought our ending loan balances roughly back to pre-pandemic levels in this quarter. As I said at Investor Day, the interest-bearing portion of our loan balances also continues to increase quarter-over-quarter, but is still below 2019 levels as pay down rates remain elevated due to the liquidity and strength amongst our customer base. This liquidity and strength is also, of course, evident as you turn to credit and provision on slides 10 through 12, as we continue to see extremely strong credit performance. Card Member loans and receivables write-off and delinquency rates remain well below pre-pandemic levels and in line with our expectations, but they did tick up a bit this quarter. As you then turn to the accounting for this credit performance, you will see that this quarter, we released a large part of the remaining credit reserves we built to capture the significant uncertainty of the pandemic, which lacked a comparable precedent. As we have seen a sustained recovery from the pandemic-driven economic shutdowns,", "doc_id": "d3c3cfd3-6aff-4901-908f-7c67de2f064c", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "679e16cf9c1745f367d9b6b088cf079a2ce5bfadbce4ff3c3d9a22eca6f5e865", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 43130, "end": 47446, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96714939-cfe7-4621-b6aa-94fae9289ebf", "2": "e8bcdece-e2a0-4011-8820-b1601fa8761b", "3": "26945960-364d-48b7-b1c7-cbb93f77ede4"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "26945960-364d-48b7-b1c7-cbb93f77ede4": {"__data__": {"text": "have seen a sustained recovery from the pandemic-driven economic shutdowns, we have been able to reduce pandemic-driven reserves. While there clearly is still plenty of uncertainty today related to the current geopolitical and inflationary environment, we believe that our CECL models are better able to capture our expected credit risk related to these uncertainties to determine the appropriate level of reserves required. Our strong credit performance combined with the adjustment to our reserves drove a $33 million provision expense benefit for the first quarter as the low write-offs were fully offset by the net reserve release as shown on slide 11. As you see on slide 12, we ended the first quarter with $3.1 billion of reserves, representing 3.3% of our loan balances and 0.1% of our card member receivable balances, respectively. This is well below the reserve levels we had pre-pandemic, given the strong credit performance we've seen. Going forward, as loan balances, especially the interest-bearing portion of loan balances, build more meaningfully, we expect delinquency and loss rates to continue to slowly move up over time, but remain below pre-pandemic levels this year. We would also expect to end the year with a higher level of reserves on our balance sheet than where we ended this quarter, although there could be some quarterly volatility in reserve adjustments throughout the year. As we move to revenue on slide 13, I do need to explain some changes we've made to our revenue reporting before moving on to results. As a reminder, we began reporting processed volumes in the first quarter of last year to better differentiate between volume and cards we issue versus those who are we play more of a network role. For added transparency, we now have moved all of the revenues associated with these volumes out of discount revenue, other fees and commissions, other revenue and combined them into a newly created line called Processed Revenue, which you can then match up against our processed volumes. We have also consolidated the remaining balances from other fees and commissions and other revenue into one line named Service Fees and Other Revenue with the largest components of this line item being service fees earned from merchants like those generated by our loyalty coalition business; and foreign currency-related revenues, such as FX conversion fees. This revenue line was up strong with 42% growth year-over-year in the first quarter, as you will see on the next slide. This growth was primarily driven by the uptick we have seen in travel-related revenues. And as I said at Investor Day, we expect this to be a pandemic recovery tailwind throughout this year. You will see we have recast prior periods in the disclosures that accompany our earnings release. A description of these reporting changes and definitions for key terms will also be included in our Form 10-Q. With these changes out of the way, let's move to our actual revenue performance beginning on slide 14. Total revenues were up 29% year-over-year in the first quarter with broad-based revenue growth across all lines. Our largest revenue line, discount revenue grew 38% year-over-year in Q1 on an FX adjusted basis, as you can see on slide 15. This growth was driven by both our sustained growth in goods and services spending and continued recovery of T&E spending. Net card fee revenues were up 16% year-over-year in the first quarter on an FX-adjusted basis, with growth reaccelerating versus the 10% to 11% growth rate seen in 2021 as you can see on slide 16. As I said at Investor Day, this growth is largely driven by bringing new accounts onto our fee-paying products as a result of the investments we've made in our premium value propositions and the continued attractive of those value propositions to both prospects and existing customers. This quarter, we acquired 3 million new cards with acquisitions of US consumer and US business Platinum Card members reaching record high, as Steve noted earlier, demonstrating great demand for our products, especially our premium fee-based products. Moving on to net interest income. On slide 17, you will see that it surpassed 2019 levels for the first time this quarter, mainly driven by lower interest expense, in part due to our increased mix of", "doc_id": "26945960-364d-48b7-b1c7-cbb93f77ede4", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "c18f0a002665a53a7590cc258c55eaacc3791a4821dca17ab02d01ce1754c9be", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 47453, "end": 51758, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96714939-cfe7-4621-b6aa-94fae9289ebf", "2": "d3c3cfd3-6aff-4901-908f-7c67de2f064c", "3": "ef350c77-25b3-4bb1-9e82-9976f29a1cec"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "ef350c77-25b3-4bb1-9e82-9976f29a1cec": {"__data__": {"text": "quarter, mainly driven by lower interest expense, in part due to our increased mix of deposits, which is generally our lowest cost funding source, particularly in today's rising rate environment. First quarter year-over-year net interest income growth of 20%, while very strong, remains slower than the growth in our lending AR, as revolving loan balances continue to rebuild and so we expect net interest income to be a pandemic recovery tailwind to our revenue growth in 2022. To sum up, on revenues on slide 18, we're tracking well against our expectations. And looking forward, we still expect to see revenue growth of 18% to 20% for the full year of 2022. So all of the revenue momentum, we just discussed, was driven by the investments we've been making in marketing, value propositions, coverage, technology and talent. And those investments show up across the expense lines you see on slide 19. Starting with variable customer engagement expenses, the strong spending growth and customer engagement that Steve discussed earlier is driving the growth in these expenses lines. In total, these costs came in at 41% of total revenues for the first quarter and are tracking in line with our expectations for variable customer engagement costs to right around 42% of total revenues for the full year. On the marketing line, we invested $1.2 billion in the first quarter, on track with our expectation to spend around $5 billion in 2022. We feel really good about the strong momentum of our new card acquisitions, as I talked about earlier. And more importantly, about the revenues from those acquisitions, which is trending significantly higher than what we saw pre-pandemic. We continue to see great demand for our products across a wide range of attractive investment opportunities, even beyond those we are currently funding. Moving to the bottom of slide 19. Operating expenses were $3.1 billion in the first quarter, tracking with our expectation to spend a bit over to $12 billion for the full year. While OpEx was up 26% year-over-year this quarter, it is important to note that we were growing over a benefit of $384 million in net mark-to-market gains in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio from the first quarter of last year, including in the OpEx line. I would point out that, what I said earlier that, inflation is having some modest positive impact on volumes, it is also putting some pressure on our operating expenses, but we'll have to wait to see how material any impact might be for the full year. In any event, I still expect to have far less growth in OpEx compared to revenues and see these costs as a key source of leverage. Turning next to capital, on slide 20, we returned $1.9 billion of capital to our shareholders in the first quarter, including common stock repurchases of $1.5 billion and $394 million in common stock dividends, on the back of strong earnings generation. Our CET1 ratio was 10.4% at the end of the first quarter, within our target range of 10% to 11%. We plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while supporting our balance sheet growth. That brings me to our growth plan on slide 21, and then we'll open up the call for your questions. For the full year 2022, we are reaffirming our guidance of having revenue growth of 18% to 20% and earnings share between $9.25 and $9.65. We continue to expect the amount of our volumes, revenues and core earnings to sequentially strengthen throughout the year, driven in part by our pandemic recovery tailwinds. As I mentioned earlier, clearly uncertainty as it relates to the current geopolitical and inflationary environment. As we sit here today, despite that uncertainty, the combination of our investments, successful execution of our strategy and a number of structural shifts have all come together to deliver our strong first quarter results and build growth momentum. We remain committed to executing against our new growth plan and running the company with a focus on achieving our aspiration of delivering revenue growth in excess of 10% and mid-teens EPS growth on a sustainable basis in 2024 and beyond.

With that, I'll turn the call back over to Vivian. Thank you, Jeff. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will now open up the line for questions. Alan?  Our first question will come from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Go ahead please. Thanks. Good morning. Obviously, the T&E rebound is happening at a brisk pace despite some of these lingering concerns on COVID cases, economic weakness. Jeff, you mentioned large corporate also that recently saw a strong rebound recently. Could you talk about how much of the volume rebound is being driven by unit demand versus sort of inflationary pressures? And how worried are you or your corporate clients about some of these issues like supply chain constraints and the economic concerns? Thanks. So let me start and Jeff can maybe add some color as well. But this is not being driven by inflation, try and book a flight. So that's not inflation. Now that doesn't mean that the airline prices are not a little bit higher. But not just for T&E, but just for the overall business, transactions are up. We had billings up 35%. That's not sort of driven all by inflation. We don't have 35% of inflation. But -- as far as travel goes, you have to realize, people have not been traveling for probably two years. There's a tremendous pent-up demand for travel. I mean our bookings, just from a consumer perspective, on a global basis were up about 38% -- 37%. In the U.S., they were up 48%. That's not over last year. That's over 2019. So people are looking to get out there and travel. And I think that's what's driving us. That is not -- it is not inflation driven when we look at that T&E number. The other thing I think is important with the T&E number, 121% is a great number, but also let's put it in context. Is 121% over last year, it's not 121% over 2019. So we're not all the way back. Consumers back, but we're not all the way back. As far as large corporations go, and we're seeing it in our own company, people are looking to get out and not only gather with their own colleagues, but they're also looking to get out and meet with customers. You're seeing conferences come back and so forth. And so I know in our own company, we are getting together as a senior management team, our top 100, 150 people. We have some sales meetings that are going on because people have not seen each other, as well as you're seeing customers opening up their offices. And I think as far as COVID affecting all of this, I think we are starting to learn to live with this. The reality is COVID is not something I think we've all learned that is going away. We'll wind up dealing with this as we deal with the flu, as we deal with Scepter, as we deal with other viruses, people will continue to get have colds and get sick and off will go. But I think the world is opening back up at this point, and people are excited to go out and see the world again, both from a business perspective and from a consumer perspective. The only thing I would briefly add, Sanjay, is when you think about travel and entertainment spend, some of that increase is not so much inflation as it is a return to people buying more front of airplane or high-end hotel or high-end restaurant oriented. Some of that is the business travel rebound where your average business travel purchase is, of course, much higher than the average consumer purchase. The other comment I'd make going forward is there's certainly lots of uncertainty in the world. But when you look at everything we see in our actual results and business, you just can't really see any sign of weakness that that's causing as of today. Our next question will come from the line of Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. Go ahead please. Good morning Steve and Jeff. Good morning Mihir. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. A lot has changed since guidance was initially set. And I am curious if you could maybe just talk about how your plans for the year have", "doc_id": "3538fd90-92f1-412b-b7f5-7619c2210e25", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "9ac6ec4b2f48f8c5b1eb46003ff27db7ab3d7c3711894d8c7adf34b438b538b5", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 55947, "end": 60071, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96714939-cfe7-4621-b6aa-94fae9289ebf", "2": "ef350c77-25b3-4bb1-9e82-9976f29a1cec", "3": "b314a908-0676-4c09-a6b0-76f8f46af75f"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "b314a908-0676-4c09-a6b0-76f8f46af75f": {"__data__": {"text": "And I am curious if you could maybe just talk about how your plans for the year have been evolving since they were established? Are there areas that made sense to lean into now versus what you had thought coming into the year versus maybe pulling back in others? Like I guess I'm just trying to understand the flexibility in the model, particularly on the expense side in terms of as things change, what's changing under the hood even as you maintain guidance? Maybe just give us a flavor of that? Thank you. Yeah. I think as far as flexibility, I think we demonstrated we have tremendous flexibility during the pandemic, especially as that related to our marketing expenditures. And, obviously, as consumers and business travelers didn't use cost -- our card member services, you saw flexibility there. So that -- so those things we do have some control over. But as far as the plan and the guidance that we have, we feel really comfortable where we are from a $9.25 to $9.65. But more importantly, I think we feel comfortable on what we are doing day by day to make sure that we are in line with tracking what our 2024 growth aspirations, which is a sustainable 10% revenue and mid-teens EPS. And that's how we're running the company. As far as what we see under the hood, we see, as Jeff mentioned, a range of good investment opportunities and you have to understand, when we see investment opportunities from a card acquisition perspective, they are here today and gone tomorrow. So if you don't act on them, you don't get them. And so we will continue to drive value, shareholder value by continuing to invest in the business and to grow the business for the medium to the long term. And that's been a strategy that's worked for us, and that is going to be how we're going to run it. But right now, if I was to look at the beginning of the year versus now, I probably see better investment opportunities today than I did with the plan. But as we know, those investment opportunities, they pay back over time. And what they do is they set us up better for 2023 and for 2024. So we feel really good about the guidance. We feel really good about the underlying investments that we're making and we'll continue to make. The only sort of simple financial summary, I put to that here \u2013 when we gave the guidance for our revenue ambitions are quite ambitious, we feel really good about the momentum we built, but we have more investment opportunities, as I said in my remarks, than we probably anticipated, and maybe a little bit of pressure on costs from inflation. So all of those things, I think, position us really well to build momentum towards our long-term target of sustainable over 10% revenue growth. Our next question will come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Go ahead. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning, John. So given the expected Fed moves to cool the economy and team inflation, what degree of slowing in network volumes or build business volumes, let's go with do you incorporate in your outlook? And then on the T&E side, I know you indicated, it's up nicely and continues in April. How do you view this trend being as the Fed tightens and the economy cools through the year? There\u2019s been general comment, I would make, John, as you know, we don't have in-house economists. So we tend to say, we should run the economy and run our guide to run the business, run our guidance based on the macroeconomic consensus, which is not for there to be a recession. And the Fed will say that, they are certainly focused on bringing inflation down without causing a recession. So that's what's built into our guidance, and that's how we're running the company. I think as Steve pointed out earlier, we have clearly demonstrated over the last couple of years, our ability to manage the company in a very agile way and react to a scenario that's different than what I just described. But in terms of our base level of planning, I don't think it's our role to second guess that general macroeconomic consensus.

Go ahead. Hi. Good morning. Hi, Betsy. Hi, Betsy. I wanted to just dig in a little bit on the loan growth and the card fee growth. As you indicated, the loan growth is \u2013 still has room to run. So maybe \u2013 and as well the impact on the NII. So maybe you could help us understand, is it the NII that's likely to accelerate here, but loan growth will be stabilizing, or how are you thinking about that? And also how it relates to the card fees, which I noticed were up nicely in the quarter? Thanks. Well, card fees are up because we continue to acquire more cards, and we're continuing to acquire. And I think we acquired 68% of the consumer cards we acquired were fee-based cards, which is still slightly below where we were, I think, pre-pandemic. So what is \u2013 what is important to understand is our card -- the majority of our card fee growth comes from new cards that we acquire. So, it doesn't just come from the fee increase, but we've also had a fee increase, which will come in over time. So, we feel really good about where we are from a card fee perspective. Let me just make one comment on sort of our overall loan growth, and then Jeff can get into the details. But the reality is pre-pandemic, we were growing slightly faster than the industry. We tend to have a lower share of our card members loan wallets than we do have their spending wallet. And our intent is to grow judiciously, but we will probably hope to get back to growing and -- we are growing fast we are growing faster than the industry, but to get our balances back up. But I'll let Jeff comment on the rest. Well, I just emphasize financial location, Steve, of what you just said, which is we are now that growing those lending balances faster than the industry, and we absolutely expect that to continue. So, there's a lot of runway for growth on the lending side. And because of quarters like we just had with a record level of new US platinum and Gold Cards on the consumer side and a record level of US business Platinums, I'd expect net car fee growth to probab, ['Steve Squeri', 'Mihir Bhatia', 'Steve Squeri ', 'John Pancari', 'Vivian Zhou', 'Betsy Graseck', 'Jeff Campbell', 'Operator', 'Sanjay Sakhrani']\n2, VZ, 1, 2022, 2022-04-22 12:27:05, Good morning, and welcome to the Verizon First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open up for questions following the presentation.  Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn over the call to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thanks, Angela. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I\u2019m here with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. Before we get started, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. Now let\u2019s take a look at consolidated earnings for the first quarter. In the first quarter, we reported earnings of $1.09 per share on a GAAP basis. Reported first quarter earnings include a pretax loss from special items of approximately $1.5 billion.

In addition, the impact of amortization of intangible assets related to TracFone and other acquisitions was $238 million. Excluding the effects of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.35 in the first quarter. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Hans to take us through a recap of the first quarter. Thank you, Brady. Good morning and thanks for joining us for this earnings call. It was great to see so many of you at our Investor Day earlier in March. During the first quarter, the team stayed focused and continued to execute on our Network as a Service strategy. This strategy underpins our five vectors of growth and a diverse path to revenue growth that set us apart and set us up for today and tomorrow. To that end, I\u2019m pleased with the progress we made across our five vectors during the first quarter. We continued to make headway towards our long-term targets and delivered a solid start to the year, even in the phase of competitive and macroeconomic pressures. Matt will go deeper on these topics later on. With that, let\u2019s get into results at the high level. Our first quarter adjusted EPS results of $1.35 proves our ability to execute and deliver profitability. This demonstrates our unique position of having both a focused strategy and strong execution capabilities to meet the needs of our four stakeholders in the growing 5G economy. It all starts with our network expansion and execution. As you\u2019ve heard me say many, many times, mobility, broadband and cloud are the essential pieces of the 21st century\u2019s infrastructure. We\u2019re already taking advantage of this infrastructure and capitalizing on an addressable market that is growing as consumers and businesses adopt 5G. We saw this growth in our wireless sales, our customer loyalty and the rapid expansion of our fixed wireless business in this quarter. Across the business, our wireless activations were up 11% year-over-year and we delivered our best Q1 full net add performance since 2018. Additionally, our fixed wireless started to benefit from the launch of C-Band during the quarter, helping to amplify our national broadband strategy and deliver our highest broadband net adds in over a decade. We continue to deploy C-Band rapidly, enabling more and more of our customers to enjoy our Ultra Wideband experience, while also accelerating and amplifying our 5G revenue opportunities. A strategic pillar in our network expansion is our C-Band build-out, which combined with our continued millimeter wave rollout further establish and strengthens our network leadership with RootMetrics ranking us again as the most reliable 5G network in the United States and we have just started with the C-Band deployment. At the Super Bowl, we demonstrated the power of 5G to deliver new in-stadium and home experiences. For example, fans streaming the halftime show had access to multiple camera angles over our network to fully immerse in the entertainment experience, only something that can be done with 5G Ultra. This is just a taste of the new customer experience we and our partners are beginning to build on 5G Ultra. This is all based on a strong belief in giving our customers maximum optionality like Mix & Match, multi-cloud partners that allow our business customer choice for the digital transformation on 5G mobile edge compute, choice on premium experience with Verizon Up and choices of streaming services with exclusive deals only on Verizon. Just this week, we announced HBO Max will be offered on our +play platform. We\u2019re empowering our customers to choose the services they need and we\u2019re delivering on it. Our  focus is reflected in our first quarter results as we saw continued momentum with step-ups and elevated device upgrades from our customers. As we previously mentioned, as technology megatrends further shift how we will work and live, 2022 is a year for Verizon to scale execution. The world continues to transition toward increased connectivity and the telecommunications industry\u2019s role in building our future has never been more vital.

Through our key investments across our portfolio of assets, we will continue to build on our unique competitive position in the industry and drive growth across all of our five vectors. As we said before, 5G adoption is already much faster than what we saw when we changed from 3G to 4G. A year after 4G launched, less than 10% of the users had a compatible device. A year after the launch of 5G Dynamic Spectrum Sharing, about 24% of our customers were on 5G devices. 5G device penetration is significant and we expect it will reach 60% of our wireless consumers by the end of 2023, up from 40% at the end of the first quarter. Let me now talk about the momentum in our Business Group. Verizon Business Group continues to have a very strong momentum in wireless. I\u2019m proud to report that Tami and her team delivered the best quarterly full net adds since we formed Verizon Business Group and they are just getting started. We\u2019re also rapidly building our 5G mobile edge compute and private 5G networks. Verizon was first in the industry to offer MEC services. This quarter we partnered with Cisco to deliver the low latency connectivity necessary for autonomous vehicles. As a partner of choice across all categories, we also made our first 5G agreement with a premium global automaker, and we will bring 5G connectivity to the next generation of Audi models starting with their 2024 vehicles. This IoT momentum expands across all our verticals with another strong net add performance this quarter. We\u2019re also seeing very promising progress in our private 5G network capabilities, offering small, mid-market and large enterprise clients, turnkey plug-and-play services. I\u2019m also pleased to share that our C-Band launched an aggressive execution to generated nationwide customer enthusiasm for our broadband offerings. Total new broadband customers were the highest in over a decade, with 229,000 net adds driven by a strong increase of 194,000 fixed wireless access net adds. And this is not the one-off. You can see from the current broadband trends that the demand for fixed wireless is extremely high and growing. In the consumer business, we grew postpaid average revenue per account by 2.6% as our users upgraded new 5G packages. ARPA growth is a major part of the strategy that we presented at the Investor Day. In the value market, the TracFone integration continues to unlock an addressable consumer market that we have only just scratched the surface on. We now have the ability to service customers in all segments regardless of the macroeconomic outlook. Manon and I were very encouraged by this opportunity and see tremendous value in the customer base Eduardo and his team have cultivated under the TracFone umbrella. The migration of TracFone subscribers from other networks continues according to plan. In addition to the result in 5G mobility, nationwide broadband, MEC and business to business and the value segment, we also see ongoing momentum in the fifth vector network monetization with growth in volumes driving incremental revenues. Of course, all of this opportunity is built on top of the best network in the industry and the deployment of our 5G Ultra Wideband technology. Kyle and team now have more than 35,000 millimeter wave sites on air and approximately 113 million POPs covered at quarter end with C-Band. As deployment continues and device penetration ramps, traffic on our Ultra Wideband is increasing rapidly. At the end of the first quarter, 14% of all traffic in urban areas was on 5G Ultra, the result of our combined millimeter wave and mid-band spectrum. We saw a 35% increase in millimeter wave traffic between Q4 2021 and Q1 2022. C-Band traffic grew 155% from the end of February to the end of March, where C-Band is deployed, 30% of our wireless traffic uses that spectrum. We have achieved this network evolution in the phase of ongoing supply chain disruption. As I mentioned in previous quarters, our supply chain management is world-class. And we have planned and executed extremely well to anticipate and meet the needs of our customers. We continue to work with our partners with a", "doc_id": "f68fad5d-db56-4f60-a7d4-b8a36a1226df", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "23a5bdc8774abca7569bfde6857c898c4a4d35d9c5c59615e26978cfd1efd388", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 72540, "end": 76701, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96714939-cfe7-4621-b6aa-94fae9289ebf", "2": "c6c3ac6c-aef7-4918-be3e-6f909fc1a532", "3": "500b5fdd-380b-43aa-a291-30cc24d92bf5"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "500b5fdd-380b-43aa-a291-30cc24d92bf5": {"__data__": {"text": "and meet the needs of our customers. We continue to work with our partners with a focus on our deployment targets. We remain diligent in managing a complex global supply chain and count on our expertise to help us to deal with the unexpected. As you come to expect from our technology team, progress is being made throughout our network. In March, we announced a major milestone in the advancement of our 5G network as we work with two satellite companies to secure early clearing of an additional 100 megahertz of C-Band spectrum in 30 additional markets. Rolling out our C-Band service on this spectrum will expand our 5G market by 40 million potential customers, a full year ahead of schedule. We expect to reach at least 175 million POPs by the end of 2022 on C-Band. Early spectrum clearance gives us the speed to market and accelerates the return on capital for our network investments. Having early access to these 30 major markets will support our entire business. It adds consumers and business to our addressable market. And we know from experience that we see customer interest for fixed wireless access as soon as it is available. Our network expansion also supports our mission of digital inclusion, which is key to how we serve our four stakeholders and execute our strategy according to responsible business practices. Let me spend a minute on our progress in this area. Today, we released our detailed environmental, social and governance report for 2021, and we are proud of our progress. The report covers our ESG strategy in detail and reflects how responsible business practices drive our business. During the first quarter, we completed allocating proceeds from our third green bond offering and issued our fourth $1 billion green bond, which is expected to be allocated towards renewable energy. We also continue to pursue long-term carbon footprint goals as described in previous quarters and in our ESG report. Third quarters have taken notice. We continue to be recognized for our sustainability efforts. During the quarter, MSCI raised our ESG rating to AA, our highest rating to date. And Sustainalytics ranked us strong in ESG risk management and low in overall ESG risk, putting us above our U.S. telecom competitors. As always, what it means to be responsible business depends on global conditions. I\u2019m proud of Verizon\u2019s relief efforts to support Ukraine, including extending free calling to and from Ukraine since the start of the war. Taken together, Verizon remains well positioned to compete this year. Our first quarter performance puts us on track for this pivotal investment year, and we remain well positioned to achieve our long-term growth targets. Now I will hand the call over to Matt to address our results in detail, as well as some updates on the 2022 guidance. Thank you, Hans. And good morning, everyone. At our Investor Day last month, we talked about 2022 as a critical year for scaling the business and making investments to position Verizon for the long-term. And this quarter, we may progress along that path. At that event, we said we expect to generate an incremental $14 billion of service and other revenue from the business by 2025, and that we expect to get there through leveraging our unique collection of assets against our five growth vectors. We expect over 75% of our growth over the next four years will come from 5G mobility and nationwide broadband. And our performance in the first quarter gives us confidence in our growth prospects. Our consumer and business units will measure success in mobility by how we perform in the areas of ARPA, premium unlimited penetration and subscribers and accounts. We\u2019ve talked about our plans for increasing the value of our existing base of wireless customers through step up to higher value data plans. The first quarter saw us achieve an increase in consumer postpaid ARPA of 2.6% year-over-year, positioning us for high quality revenue and earnings growth going forward. 64% of new accounts selected premium unlimited, and together with continued step-up momentum drove our premium penetration up to 36%. With respect to subscribers and new accounts, for the first quarter, we reported postpaid phone net losses of 36,000, which represents an improvement of 142,000 or 80% from a year ago and our best", "doc_id": "500b5fdd-380b-43aa-a291-30cc24d92bf5", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "51124340b59e1e5c4a4264ccc8b2ee3ce9909716e31634b2e099ecfa97669d57", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 76709, "end": 81019, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96714939-cfe7-4621-b6aa-94fae9289ebf", "2": "f68fad5d-db56-4f60-a7d4-b8a36a1226df", "3": "bf261158-91d5-42a9-bbe6-a2847e52059a"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "bf261158-91d5-42a9-bbe6-a2847e52059a": {"__data__": {"text": "which represents an improvement of 142,000 or 80% from a year ago and our best first quarter performance since 2018. The performance was driven by our business team, which contributed a record 256,000 phone net adds, the highest from the unit since Verizon 2.0 reporting began. These results were driven by strength in the three wireless customer groups as SMB, Enterprise, and Public Sector, each delivered double digit phone gross ad growth and extended the momentum built in the second half of last year. We expect this strong performance to continue as we approach something closer to a pre pandemic environment. On the Consumer side phone net losses were 292,000 in the quarter. While churn was study, we saw a decline in phone gross adds of 2% from the prior year. This gross add trend was more pronounced in March and is continuing into April. We will continue to take appropriate measures to be competitive in the market. We are pleased with the quality of the business that we are writing and are confident in the value of the postpaid phone gross adds we are attracting. Our retail postpaid accounts at the end of Q1 across Consumer and Business are up 40,000 from last year. Consumer and Business segment performance in the nationwide broadband vector was strong and demonstrates the opportunity to scale this business. We measure our success against this vector by households and businesses covered by broadband and the total subscribers on our networks. As Hans mentioned, the early clearance spectrum announcement is a major milestone for Verizon. Our network team is now able to deploy this spectrum a full year sooner than expected unlocking another 40 million of addressable population. We feel confident that our C-Band network will cover at least 175 million POPs by the end of this year, and will cover 50 million household and 14 million businesses with fixed wireless access by the end of 2025. The addressable opportunity expansion continues in Fios as well with 115,000 incremental open for sale in the quarter. We are seeing strong uptake in our broadband offers, and we expect increasing momentum as more and more people get access to our 5G Ultra Wideband and find service throughout the year. We had 194,000 fixed wireless access net adds across the portfolio, which is 2.5 times our 4Q 2021 performance. Consumers continue to see the benefit of the speed, reliability, and simplicity of installation of the FWA product. And businesses continue to recognize that FWA can be a primary broadband access solution for all of their needs. The total broadband, we registered 229,000 net ads representing our highest net ads in over a decade. Fios Internet contributed 60,000 net ads within the quarter, driven by record low levels of churn. Now let\u2019s move on to the MEC & B2B solutions vector. Tami and the team continue to make great progress in this space. Within IoT, the team delivered another strong quarter of connection growth. We\u2019re seeing success across our verticals, working with our customers to deliver the solutions that they need. As we mentioned during our Investor Day, we anticipate that connections will continue to grow at a double-digit pace. With our investments and key partnerships, we continue to expand the ecosystem for MEC, as well as advance our deployments in private wireless and private MEC. Our market differentiation is unmatched in terms of scale and capabilities. And we are well positioned to accelerate our long-term revenue growth within this space. Now, let\u2019s talk about the value market. Q1 marks a first full quarter of TracFone included in our consumer results. Our integration of TracFone is going as planned, and we are pleased with the progress we are making. We measure our success in the value market based on prepaid ARPU, prepaid subscribers, and prepaid revenue. Prepaid ARPU in the quarter was $30.89 across all of our prepaid brands. This declined in part because TracFone ARPU is lower than our legacy Verizon prepaid ARPU. Additionally, we saw quarter-over-quarter pressure specifically in the TracFone brands in part due to the transition from the Emergency Broadband Benefit program to the affordable connectivity program, which negatively impacted ARPUs benefits dropped from $50 to $30. Going forward, we expect prepaid ARPU to stabilize and subsequently", "doc_id": "bf261158-91d5-42a9-bbe6-a2847e52059a", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "c11d2050b09844c331cfbdf9a88d2aa9913ab0f2f04bd6eb3db7ab8a1cfaab02", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 81022, "end": 85357, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96714939-cfe7-4621-b6aa-94fae9289ebf", "2": "500b5fdd-380b-43aa-a291-30cc24d92bf5", "3": "bc1b0abf-4fed-49f4-88d9-81000b818743"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "bc1b0abf-4fed-49f4-88d9-81000b818743": {"__data__": {"text": "$30. Going forward, we expect prepaid ARPU to stabilize and subsequently grow as we execute in our strategy to bring additional value to this space. While we experience certain device inventory pressure throughout the quarter, especially in January, the team finished strong and delivered first quarter volumes in TracFone that compare favorably to of prior years, excluding 2021 activity, which benefited from stimulus programs. Our TracFone brands had net prepaid losses of $77,000, while total Verizon prepaid net losses in the quarter were $80,000. Next let\u2019s move to the consolidated financial results on Slide 14. On a consolidated basis, Verizon delivered strong wireless service revenue growth in a highly competitive environment in the first quarter. Total wireless service revenue growth was 9.5%, reflecting the first full quarter of TracFone ownership, as well as continued execution of our Network-as-a-Service strategy and contributions from our five vectors of growth. Service and other revenue was down 2.5% in the quarter, as the revenues lost from Verizon Media more than offset net incremental revenue from TracFone. Excluding the impact of the sale of Verizon Media, service and other revenue was up 4.2% from the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was $12.0 billion in for the quarter down year-over-year by 1.1% do in part to elevated marketing expenses. We introduced our 5G Ultra Campaign at the beginning of the year to support our C-Band launch and FWA expansion. Combined with lower spending on the first quarter of 2021 driven by COVID-related impacts on our operations, marketing expenses represented a year-over-year drag on first quarter EBITDA growth. Other items impacting Q1 EBITDA including the disposition of Verizon Media, which had EBITDA levels above those that TracFone added in the quarter, especially considering the investment we\u2019re starting to put into the TracFone brands. We expect marketing expenses to return to more normal levels in Q2. And we will begin to lap the prior year ramp up in tower expenses, which also represented a year-over-year pressure in Q1. As Brady and Hans highlighted, adjusted EPS for the first quarter was a $1.35, relatively in line with prior year. The bottom-line performance shows the strength of our core business to deliver profitability, even in a period of significant investment, as well as other headwinds. Now let\u2019s take a look at our Consumer financial results in Q1. Total Consumer revenue for the quarter grew 10.9% year-over-year, driven by first full quarter of TracFone inclusion, higher equipment revenue, and strong core wireless service revenue growth. Wireless service revenue was up 11.2% year-over-year. These results were driven by the inclusion of TracFone as well as our increase in postpaid ARPA, which was driven by the strong step-up momentum I discussed earlier and growth within our non-connectivity products and services. Moving to File Services, we continue to see volume and rate gains with broadband of setting pressures from video and voice as total files revenue grew 1.8%. Consumer EBITDA was $10.5 billion up year-over-year by 1.0%. This growth is a result of the inclusion TracFone as well as ARPA and customer volume gains, partially offset by the items mentioned earlier, such as higher marketing expenses, investments in TracFone and higher bad debt, driven mainly by higher sales volumes in the quarter. Similarly, the higher sales activity resulted in elevated equipment revenue, pressuring EBITDA margins, which were 41.4% in the quarter. Margins were additionally pressured by the inclusion of the results of TracFone, which is a business that has historically operated with margins below the legacy consumer business. Now let\u2019s take a closer look at the business financial results on Slide 16. The Verizon Business Group continues to see strong wireless sales and service momentum within the business space, alongside the ongoing wireline service declines. Wireless service revenue growth of 2.1% was led by momentum in our SMB Group, which continues to see strong post-pandemic recovery. The rate", "doc_id": "bc1b0abf-4fed-49f4-88d9-81000b818743", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "e35fa726648352cdb1b1eddcef97bfa0a58456023c9543e1f1d6533b0f13e748", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 85360, "end": 89471, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96714939-cfe7-4621-b6aa-94fae9289ebf", "2": "bf261158-91d5-42a9-bbe6-a2847e52059a", "3": "918a9803-abb4-436a-a2d6-6efc28f4164c"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "918a9803-abb4-436a-a2d6-6efc28f4164c": {"__data__": {"text": "Group, which continues to see strong post-pandemic recovery. The rate of growth is an improvement from last quarter\u2019s 1.5% and with 1Q last year representing the peak for distance learning devices, we expect Business wireless service revenue growth to expand over the rest of 2022. Business EBITDA was $1.7 billion for the quarter, down 9.3% from the prior year. The decline in EBITDA was driven in part by the ongoing reduction in high margin wireline revenue. Additionally, we experienced elevated levels of subsidy related to the strong wireless Q1 sales volume, which were up 20% year-over-year. EBITDA margin was 22.5%, similarly impacted by wireline service trends and wireless sales volumes. Let\u2019s move to Slide 17, the cashflow summary. Cashflow from operating activities for the quarter totaled $6.8 billion, compared with $9.7 billion from the prior year. The reduction was primarily due to working capital impacts as the increase in activation volumes to more normal levels impacted receivables and inventory increased as part of our supply chain management in the current environment. Capital spending for the first quarter, totaled $5.8 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion compared to last year, driven by C-Band spending of $1.5 billion. The continued build out of OneFiber and our investment to support growth of traffic on our 4G LTE network while expanding the reach and capacity of our 5G Ultra Wideband network great extends our opportunity to effectively compete in all of our businesses. The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow for the quarter of $1.0 billion. We exited the quarter with $135.6 billion of net unsecured debt, an increase of $1.9 billion sequentially as we issued our fourth Green Bond, with the net proceeds expected to be allocated to renewable energy. In addition, we completed a number of other transactions during the quarter the proceeds of which were used as consideration in an over $5 billion tender offer to retire some higher cost, long-term debt. We ended the quarter with a net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 2.8 times flat on a sequential basis as expected. Lastly, let\u2019s move to guidance to the remainder of the year. I want to provide some additional detail around our view of the macro environment in which we operate and give context around our guidance for 2022. We saw inflationary pressures building towards the end of the first quarter and expect those to continue given the current environment. The major areas of exposure for us at energy related costs for our network operations and transportation, as well as labor related costs, including both our direct workforce and third parties. While these items have not had a significant impact on our overall results to date, they represent a meaningful portion of our direct cost structure and have the potential to drive additional expense pressure throughout the rest of the year. We also believe that the inflation we are seeing throughout the economy may alter both the consumer and business landscaping, which we compete. It is too early to predict how this change landscape may impact our near-term results or how long it will last. But we are confident that the strategy we have put in place will allow us to achieve our long-term growth plans. There\u2019s also been a significant increase in treasury yields recently, but as a reminder, the vast majority of our debt approximately 75% to 80% is fixed rate. The team has kept near-term maturities in the next 12 months to 24 months at manageable levels, which also helps minimize near-term interest rate exposure. If the present forecast of Fed rate hikes are accurate, we anticipate an incremental cash interest impact for the year above our early expectations of $150 million to $200 million. Based on our current expectations, we are updating our guidance for the year. On the revenue side, we now anticipate service and other revenue to be approximately flat to 2021, significant items affecting our service and other revenue include USF rate reductions, which are pressuring year-over-year revenue by several hundred million and softness in wireline sales.

For CapEx, we are reiterating prior guidance of $16.5 billion to $17.5 billion for business as usual capital and $5 billion to $6 billion to see band related spending. We will continue to invest in the business and remain confident in the long-term growth opportunities discussed during our Investor Day. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Hans to close out our 2022 priorities. Thank you, Matt. Our priority about 2022 is to continue to execute on our Network as a Service strategy and to drive growth across all our five vectors. This is a critical year for scaling on our strategic investment as we work to capture all of the promise that 5G offers both from a customer experience perspective and for a future revenue growth. We made good progress in this quarter and continue to execute on our long-term plans. Our core business and our strategy showed strength and we have a solid momentum going into the second quarter, all built on the strong confidence in our strategy. Now we\u2019re ready to take your questions. Back to you Brady. Thanks, Hans. Angela, we\u2019re ready for questions. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  First question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question. Great. Thanks. I guess two quick follow-ups to all the data you guys provided. First on the EBB reimbursements, is the impact to ARPU that we saw the $5 change, is that fully reflect the changes in reimbursements. And is there any impact from a customer standpoint? And then on consumer margins, they were down 400 basis points, is that \u2013 can you separate out the impact from TracFone had and sort of underlying trends and what was driving that and just your outlook for the how it actually trend through the year. Thanks. Hey John, so good morning. Thanks for the questions. On the EEB messaging as a certainly we\u2019re seeing that change in the programs as we go forward here, but no major impact on customer volumes related to that. I think your bigger question on Verizon Consumer Group and the margins we saw in the quarter. So a couple of major things in there, certainly some so one time increases in costs as we look at the quarter. We were very, very strong on our marketing spend this quarter with the launch of C-Band, new price plans, launch of fixed wireless on C-Band as well and everything around that. So that\u2019s in the quarter we would expect that to be returned to more normal levels as we head here into second quarter and go forward. And then of course, you saw the volumes up year-over-year that has some impact in there, and then Trac I mentioned in my prepared remarks so that has an impact. Initially that\u2019s going to be in the 100 to 200 basis point range impact as you bring Trac into the overall VCG mix. And then as we work through the integration and bring all of the customers in Trac onto our network that impact will lessen as we complete the integration over the next 12 months to 24 months. So combination of things in there, but certainly would expect to see a little bit of an uptake as we head into the rest of the year here on the \u2013 our consumer margin. Got it. Yes. Great. Thanks, John. Angela, we\u2019re ready for the next question. Our next question comes from Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. Yes, thank you for taking the question. So during your prepared remarks, I think you had noted that postpaid phone gross adds had started to soften towards the end of the quarter, and that had continued into 2Q.

And then just on the cash flow, Matt, to what extent was the higher working capital use in the first quarter really a timing issue, obviously pre-buying inventory to manage the supply chain seems like a timing factor, but I guess with regards to just the elevated volumes, do you expect to ultimately have that offset either by selling off the receivables or just collecting the payments or was any of that actually associated with maybe a little bit more of a device promotion profile in the first quarter. Thank you. I start Brett and then Matt will support later on there. First of all, I mean if you look at the quarter, we had a very good wireless net adds quarter of course because if you look over the combination, our business side was very strong.

So in our fiscal Q1 2022, consolidated net revenue was a record $7.7 billion, up 16%", "doc_id": "f65906f2-c2d3-4407-91a5-77b309f69329", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "938c9f1d30c0e8e6bae7c956aa95e233f21e60040a89e5006c796216a7f4bee5", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 97775, "end": 101779, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96714939-cfe7-4621-b6aa-94fae9289ebf", "2": "e4d66d80-e749-4847-ab41-eb116d93950a", "3": "d72e23db-2d3a-4b79-94f6-c726846a376b"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "d72e23db-2d3a-4b79-94f6-c726846a376b": {"__data__": {"text": "consolidated net revenue was a record $7.7 billion, up 16% year-on-year. Semiconductor solutions revenue grew 20% year-on-year to $5.9 billion and infrastructure software revenue grew 5% year-on-year to $1.8 billion. Now enterprise demand grew very robustly from the trough we saw in Q1 last year as the recovery in enterprise IT spending continued to accelerate. Meanwhile, hyper clouds are upgrading their data centers, and service providers, telcos continue to deploy next-generation fiber-to-the-home. As expected, against the peak of a year ago, wireless grew single digits, and our core software business remains very stable and steady. On the supply front, lead times remain extended and unchanged as inventory of our products in the channel and in our customers remains lean. Our semiconductor backlog at the close of Q1 continued to grow double digits from that of the prior quarter. Let me now provide more color by end markets, starting with networking. Networking revenue of $1.9 billion was up 33% year-on-year and represented 32% of our semiconductor revenue. This strong growth was driven by deployment at scale of Tomahawk 4 and compute off loan across several hyperscale customers, as they upgrade and scale out their data centers. In enterprises, campus switching upgrades continue to accelerate. Let me talk about routing in this space. Investments in 5G backhaul by telco operators worldwide continue to drive strong growth in our Qumran family of products. More than this, the opportunity in our routing silicon has expanded into hyperscale in a very significant way, moving Ethernet into the back-end network of large-scale AI/ML clusters. In particular, I\u2019m referring to the Arista\u2019s 7800 AI platform, which scales Ethernet to connect many tens of thousands of CPUs and GPUs in hyperscale. This platform is built on our Jericho router. Our devices provide the most cost-effective fabric for AI/ML scaler with an end-to-end congestion managed lossless network and highest efficiency load balancing across the links. Now in contrast to proprietary protocols such as InfiniBand used typically in high-performance computing, we see low-latency Ethernet as the way forward for large-scale AI/ ML networks as a widely adopted open architecture. Our unique ability to network these complex AI workloads in hyperscale is extending our customized training and inference SoC footprint at several cloud guys. In Q2, we expect networking to continue to be strong across the board and revenue growth to be in excess of 30% year-over-year. Next, our server storage connectivity revenue was $801 million, and growth accelerated to 32% year-on-year, representing 14% of semiconductor revenue. This was driven in large part by the continuing recovery of enterprise IT spending, much of which was deployed towards upgrading compute service. And most of these compute service use either our MegaRAID or SAN for server storage connectivity. We are also benefiting from increased content as enterprises upgrade to next-generation storage connectivity solutions to support deployment of leading-edge service. Beyond enterprise, with proliferation of video content in social media, we see our cloud customers increasingly adopting Nearline hard disk drives as the primary storage of choice. And to manage this much arrays of hard disk drives, they deploy storage service and expanders, which utilize very much our next-generation storage connectivity, silicon and software, creating another driver for revenue growth. Interestingly, we are also a critical supply of preamplifiers and re-channels in Nearline hard disk drives, with our revenue growing at over 20% CAGR over the last five years. Our Nearline revenue represented over two-thirds of our hard drive business this quarter. With the adoption of next-generation technology here, we\u2019re selling more bots than just silicon, resulting in much higher dollar content. This dynamic, coupled with continuing strong demand from both enterprise and hyperscale is expected to accelerate Q2 server storage connectivity revenue to over 55% year-on-year. Now moving on to broadband.

Now moving on to broadband. Revenue of $911 million grew 23% year-on-year and represented 16% of semiconductor revenue. This was driven largely by increased deployment of next-generation PON and DOCSIS, our cable modem, with high attach rates of Wi-Fi 6 and 6E in home gateways. Examples of this about, last quarter, Charter announced trials of DOCSIS 4.0 running at speeds of 8.5 gigabit downstream and 6 gigabit upstream, both in CPE and remote note. Comcast start the deployment of their Wi-Fi 6E DOCSIS 3.1 gateway, and AT&T announced a multi-gig PON service on their gateways. All of these are using Broadcom SoCs. We remain the market leader in delivering Wi-Fi 6 and 6E chips to leading phones as well as routers, enterprise access point and carrier gateways. Through the first quarter of 2022, we have cumulatively shipped over 1 billion Wi-Fi 6 and 6E radios in just around three years since our launch. Our OEM customers and carrier partners are now ramping Wi-Fi 6E, the current generation of Wi-Fi making use of the 6 gigahertz band, which has increasingly been made available for unlicensed access across the globe. And as we look ahead, we are the industry leader, heavily investing in Wi-Fi 7 as the strategic complement to 10G PON and cable modem \u2013 we see \u2013 both broadband. We see this as the next step in broadband development and deployment globally. In the U.S. alone, the pending infrastructure access to site $65 billion over the next five years to connect more homes to high-speed broadband. Across the world, the same is happening as next-generation wide broadband is seen as the better alternative to 5G for home connectivity. As far as Q2 is concerned, we expect our broadband business to continue to grow 20% year-on-year. Moving on to wireless. Q1 revenue of $2 billion represented 34% of semiconductor revenue. Demand from our North American customer for our products continued to be strong during the quarter, driving wireless revenue up 10% sequentially and up 4% year-on-year from the peak quarter in fiscal 2021. As expected in Q2, wireless revenue will be seasonally down, about mid-teens quarter-on-quarter, but will still be up mid-single digits from a year ago. Finally, industrial revenue of $243 million represented approximately 4% of Q1 semiconductor revenue. Q1 resales of $239 million grew 37% year-over-year driven by robust demand from electric vehicles, renewable energy, factory automation and health care. Reflecting such strong resales, our inventory in the channel remain around one month, and we expect resales to continue to be strong in Q2. Accordingly, in summary, Q1 semiconductor solution revenue was up 20% year-on-year. Q2, we expect semiconductor revenue to accelerate to 25% year-on-year. Turning to software. In Q1, infrastructure software revenue of $1.8 billion grew 5% year-on-year and represented 24% of total revenue. Core software revenue grew 6% year-on-year. In dollar terms, consolidated renewal rates averaged 121% over expiring contracts, while in our strategic accounts, we averaged 136%. Within this strategic account, $656 million represented renewals on expiring contracts, of which $164 million represented cross-selling, including PLAs, of our portfolio products to the same customers. Over 90% of the renewal value represented recurring subscription and maintenance. Okay. ARR, annual recurring revenue, at the end of Q1 was $5.3 billion, which was up 5% from a year ago. In Q2, we expect our infrastructure software revenue to sustain around mid-single-digit percentage growth year-upon-year. In summary, in Q1, semiconductor revenue grew a strong 20%. In fact, excluding wireless, it grew \u2013 actually grew over 30%. Combined with our stable software business, consolidated revenue grew 16% year-on-year to $7.7 billion.

Layering on our stable software business, we expect Q2 consolidated revenue growth of 20% year-on-year to $7.9 billion. And before I turn this call over to Kirsten, I just want to add, Broadcom recently published its second annual ESG report available on the company\u2019s corporate citizenship site, which discusses the company\u2019s ESG initiatives. As a global technology leader, we recognized the company\u2019s responsibility to have a positive impact on our communities through our product and technology innovation and operational excellence, we remain very committed to this mission. With that, let me turn the call over to Kirsten. Thank you, Hock. Let me now provide additional detail on our financial performance. Revenue was $7.7 billion for the quarter, up 16% from a year ago. Gross margins were 76% of revenue in the quarter and up 227 basis points year-on-year. Operating expenses were $1.2 billion, up 6% year-on-year, driven by investment in research and development. Operating income for the quarter was $4.7 billion and was up 23% from a year ago. Operating margin was 60% of revenue, up approximately 362 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.8 billion or 62.5% of revenue. Note that this figure excludes $136 million of depreciation. Now a review of the P& L for our two segments. Revenue for our semiconductor solutions segment was $5.9 billion and represented 76% of total revenue in the quarter. This was up 20% year-on-year. Gross margins for our semiconductor solutions segment were approximately 71%, up 347 basis points year-on-year, driven by favorable product mix and content growth in next-generation products across our extensive product portfolio. Operating expenses were $817 million in Q1, up 9% year-on-year. R&D was $725 million in the quarter, up 10% year-on-year. Q1 semiconductor operating margins increased to 57%. So while semiconductor revenue was up 20%, operating profit grew 31%. Moving to the P&L for our infrastructure software segment. Revenue for infrastructure software was $1.8 billion and represented 24% of revenue. This was up 5% year-on-year. Gross margins for infrastructure software were 90% in the quarter, up 71 basis points year-over-year. Operating expenses were $348 million in the quarter, up 1% year-over-year. Infrastructure software operating margin was 71% in Q1, and operating profit grew 7%. Moving to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $3.4 billion, representing 44% of revenue. We spent $101 million on capital expenditures. Days sales outstanding were 30 days in the first quarter compared to 35 days a year ago. We ended the first quarter with inventory of $1.5 billion, up 17% from the end of the prior quarter, in large part due to higher material costs. Our hardware backlog at the end of the quarter was over $25 billion compared to $22 billion the preceding quarter. And our lead times remain steady at 50 weeks. Our software backlog continued to grow as well and ended the quarter at over $15 billion. As a point of reference, software backlog was $13 billion a year ago. We ended the quarter with $10.2 billion of cash and $39.5 billion of gross debt, of which $300 million is short term. Turning to capital allocation. In the quarter, we paid stockholders $1.8 billion of cash dividends. Consistent with our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, we repurchased $2.7 billion in common stock and eliminated $375 million of common stock for taxes due on vesting of employee equity, resulting in the elimination of approximately 5 million AVGO shares. The non-GAAP diluted share count in Q1 was $446 million.

Operator, please open up the call for questions. Thank you.  Our first question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Good afternoon and congratulations on the strong results and execution. Hock, given your backlog and extended lead times, you\u2019ve got pretty good visibility into this year. Your end markets are strong, right? Cloud and hyperscale CapEx spending is looking to grow about 30%. You\u2019re driving the 200 and 400 gig networking upgrade cycle. Enterprise spending is still expanding. As you mentioned, Broadcom continues strong, whether it\u2019s DOCSIS, Wi-Fi, fiber upgrades. And then on your compute acceleration ASIC pipeline, you\u2019ve got Google, Facebook, Microsoft, all of these guys ramping. So it seems like the demand, your product leadership, seasonality can sustain a sort of low to mid-20% plus type year-over-year revenue growth profile through this year. So I guess the question for you is, do you have line of sight and confidence on sustaining this type of growth through the year? And then more importantly, do you have the supply commitments to support this type of growth? I\u2019m not providing annual guidance, Harlan, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re angling for. But what you\u2019re saying makes a lot of sense. And to answer your question directly, yes, we have line of sight through end of 2022, both, we believe, in demand and in supply. Thanks, Hock. Thank you. Our next question will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Thank you for taking my question. Hock, I was hoping if you could just revisit what\u2019s driving the acceleration in growth. And then the more important question is that there is a perception that semiconductor companies are benefiting abnormally because of a pricing lever because of the tight supply conditions. And as the foundry capacity eases, that your costs will go down and the pricing advantage will disappear. And I was hoping you could give us some more color, how much of a role is pricing playing in the expected sales growth this year on a like-to-like basis versus what you saw last year? That\u2019s a very good question. And I mean, and true, the rail demand that we\u2019re seeing underlying \u2013 if you talk about underlying trend that is sustainable, at least in this typical up cycle, you\u2019re right, it\u2019s \u2013 while we\u2019re showing 30% in networking, in server storage, a part of it is driven by ASP increases simply because we are passing on our material cost increases, wafer, substrates, assembly, to our customers, inevitably. But it\u2019s much less than you probably think it is. What is really sustainable is what Harlan said in the previous question. We think the trend demand increase is more like closer to 20% year-on-year than what perhaps in dollar terms you\u2019re represented. And how long would it last? Who knows? It\u2019s hard for me to figure, because I\u2019ve been wrong so many times, and this is now going on into the almost \u2013 2022 is done and is strong. We\u2019re now booking, given our lead times I indicated, in 2023. And 2023, I think, will be \u2013 at least the first half of 2023 will still be pretty close to the same. And it\u2019s the latter part of 2023 and 2024 that we have to figure out whether there\u2019s enough supply that will start coming in to basically address what is today and what we\u2019re seeing, an extremely strong demand environment, whether it\u2019s from enterprise, telcos and service providers and hyperscale, all three are strong. Got it. So price stickiness perhaps can continue into 2023. I just wanted to clarify that.

I just wanted to clarify that. At least the first part of 2023, yes. Thank you, Hock. Thank you. Our next question will come from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Hock, I wanted to ask about gross margins. So you did like 75.5% in the quarter, 71% for semis. And if I sort of like squint at your guidance, it implies gross margins into Q2 at least at that level, if not even probably higher. And this is amid cost increases and everything else. So I mean how do we think about like the limited \u2013 I know you always talked about margins kind of going up 100 basis points a year, and they seem to be doing even better than that. Do we just keep modeling them going up from here? Or do you think they take a pause? Are there are any other drivers like into the back of this year mix or anything else that would sit on that? Just how do we think about it just given the levels that they\u2019re sitting at right now? Well, I could tread on my usual statement because it happens to be true, which is year-upon-year under normal situations, yes, we see this 100 \u2013 around 100 basis points expansion of gross margin on our semiconductor front. You get that. Now Kirsten just indicated, we did better than that in semiconductor. And I guess the \u2013 and the reason why we did better than that this season, so to speak, if you come back to my remarks, there\u2019s a lot of deployment \u2013 launch and deployment of new generation products that I mentioned. We\u2019re talking about in networking, Tomahawk 4, and much more, Trident 4, which is more towards some data centers that use in enterprises, come out for use in hyper cloud, that new generation. Then we talk about Jericho being deployed \u2013 the latest Jericho being deployed in the bank site networks of machine learning, AI, GPU in the connectivity. That\u2019s a whole new application. Then we talk in service storage, I\u2019ve talked about a whole slew of new generation solutions, which we put in place towards, basically, for new generation, leading-edge service out there from the guys who do those servers. And with those new generation, we get that better margin. So in all, I guess the additional input I put in is a lot more new generation products coming out now, happen to be in 2022 \u2013 we\u2019re seeing happen. And of course, we are, in this environment, thankfully, able to pass on our cost increases to supply \u2013 to customers. And that all adds up to a fairly decent gross margin set of results. But do not let that be an indicator, please, that it is something that will be a 200, 300 basis points expansion year-on-year. We still believe normal situation is still be just on average, 100 basis point expansion. Got it. But as long as you can keep the new products coming, we should still be able to see that 100 basis points even from here? Yes. And by the way, it\u2019s not just me having to come on new products. There\u2019s a pool. The customers, the applications of our markets require us \u2013 and that\u2019s the beautiful thing about the semiconductors and technology, is always \u2013 there always is a need for next-generation better products. Whether it\u2019s performance power, whatever, is always, there\u2019s a pool. And that product life cycle is what enables us to develop these new products, and our margins will keep expanding. Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you so much. Thank you. Our next question will come from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Hi, thanks for let me ask a question. Hock, thanks for the information on the backlog for the semi business. It\u2019s good to see that rising as much as it did sequentially, especially considering the lead times stayed flat. While the magnitude is impressive, I really want to ask about the profile of that and how it may or may not be changing. So as that additional backlog comes in, given all the moving parts between enterprise and cloud and broadband and wireless, et cetera, any sort of changes in the profile of that backlog that you find to be interesting, either in a", "doc_id": "fe379ddf-9f5b-4b1a-a985-0a3e7b20f86c", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "284ac0a25e1b7169b64ba30523e4c7248e97f163657e243e248fd4ddb031b0e0", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 117594, "end": 121615, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96714939-cfe7-4621-b6aa-94fae9289ebf", "2": "18643539-068a-4c52-8da7-63417088dbcc", "3": "31404d66-0f6d-4317-b39d-fc2577613a82"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "31404d66-0f6d-4317-b39d-fc2577613a82": {"__data__": {"text": "sort of changes in the profile of that backlog that you find to be interesting, either in a positive or negative sense that will give us a clue about the future growth drivers for your company? That\u2019s a good question. And I employed in some of my point \u2013 some of my remarks, but let me take you directly. Yes, enterprise, enterprise demand, spending is the strongest driver that we\u2019re seeing today. And it should be no surprise, because something we have said since last quarter and the quarter before, enterprise has recovered more \u2013 than recovered \u2013 is going \u2013 it\u2019s on fire, is the best way to describe it. Enterprise spending on IT is, as we perceive it, on fire. And we are seeing a big part of that. And that\u2019s not to say that hyper cloud and telcos are not adding to it, but not as strong as enterprise recovery. Any negative surprises in that? You talked about the positive side. Is there anything that\u2019s been surprising on the negative side? No. Not really. It\u2019s just \u2013 that\u2019s \u2013 I think there\u2019s a lot of pent-up spending. There\u2019s a lot of need for a lot of enterprises to upgrade. And that\u2019s also what\u2019s driving, as I indicated in my remarks, a lot of on-prem campus switching investment going in. I mean look at even Broadcom. We\u2019ve been using Wi-Fi in our hot spots, in our excess gateways, in \u2013 through the campus. A key part of it is wireless connectivity, Wi-Fi, so to speak way. I mean we\u2019ve been running Wi-Fi 5 for many years. Now is the time to move to Wi-Fi 6, 6E. And we\u2019re not the only one we\u2019re seeing across the board, very strong demand from lots of enterprises wanting to upgrade connectivity as offices start to slowly open up. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question will come from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Yes, guys. Thanks for let me ask the question. Hock, usually at this point in the cycle with lead times extended as much as they are and you guys getting pricing power, the big concern on Wall Street is to what extent is the demand you\u2019re seeing real demand versus perhaps your customers building inventory. And I know you\u2019re less consumer focused than most. And so maybe inventory builds are less relevant in some of these infrastructure markets. But I\u2019m wondering if you could give us your perspective on \u2013 or at least what you guys try to do to scrub the backlog to make sure it\u2019s good demand. And if you think it\u2019s good demand, I\u2019m kind of curious, you\u2019ve always had a very realistic view of what the long-term growth rate for your semi should be \u2013 semi business should be. Is that beginning to change? And like many of your peers who have put up a higher kind of new CAGR, are you willing to go there right now? Let\u2019s answer the first question first, and let me go to the last one and the best at the end. But on the first part, yes, as I\u2019ve stated in previous earnings calls, I\u2019m more than happy to reiterate it here, which is we are very, very concerned, obviously, that you could \u2013 we could easily build up inventory in various parts of our demand environment, just because we ship according to what customer sending in orders as their customer requested. So we don\u2019t \u2013 we actually spend a huge amount of bandwidth of our operations and salespeople in this environment to make sure we get products to any particular customer just when they need it. Not any earlier and hopefully not too late either because we like to address customer a real need in that regard. But what\u2019s very, very important to us is not to ship excessively. And inventory, whether it\u2019s in the customer inventory, in distribution, the nice thing about our business in semiconductor is this, 75% of our revenue comes from just about 100 customers, and they\u2019re direct. The last 25% go through distribution. 75% direct to 100 customers. We have enough salespeople. We have enough visibility on these customers to know exactly pretty closely, we\u2019d like to think, what they need and ship to", "doc_id": "31404d66-0f6d-4317-b39d-fc2577613a82", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "9d8aa969a27018b043ea9b6e5001cccd396e1097582c60c5e34f7419844de9d9", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 121593, "end": 125513, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96714939-cfe7-4621-b6aa-94fae9289ebf", "2": "fe379ddf-9f5b-4b1a-a985-0a3e7b20f86c", "3": "70faad6b-05d4-43c4-9fbe-a56005592683"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "70faad6b-05d4-43c4-9fbe-a56005592683": {"__data__": {"text": "exactly pretty closely, we\u2019d like to think, what they need and ship to what exactly they need. And when we do all that, I said it before in last earnings call, true in demand growth \u2013 true growth as we have been seeing in 2021, it was about 20% year-on-year improvement. Now we now take on the fact that material costs have gone up in 2022. So there\u2019s an addition beyond 20%. I still believe it\u2019s about 20% in response to earlier in this environment because the last up cycle we saw in 2017, it was 20% year-on-year improvement. It wasn\u2019t stronger than that. And by the way, we sell mostly those big core system on a chip into any platform that our customer builds and sells. We do \u2013 and generally, we get very good visibility. If we were to sell more of the peripheral chips, the secondary chips, that adds up to the total platform, and that cause a fraction of what our system on a chip cost. Then perhaps you will not have that visibility, and we believe there are a lot of pockets of those inventory in the wrong places because of unbalanced chipsets sitting out there. But if you \u2013 for example, if you\u2019re building a data center and you need 1,000 Tomahawk 4s, believe me, you will not buy more than 1,050 Tomahawk 4s. But if you buying voltage regulator, you probably buy 2,000, 3,000 of those voltage regulators just in case. And that\u2019s the difference in what we\u2019re seeing. So we think we get a good sense of what\u2019s out there. And the kicker here is the price increase that was passed on because of wafer cost and substrate cost increases, which makes it go over perhaps what we think is a sustainable level. Now to answer your longer-term question, no, I don\u2019t think on a long-term, say, next 10 years, would the CAGR change, I think people will say that CAGR change, frankly, are probably dreaming because there\u2019s no evidence on our side to show why this industry, which is relatively mature semiconductor industry, should suddenly spiral into a different trend growth rate. We have seen in the last 10 years, compounded roughly 5% annual growth rate. And there\u2019s nothing to indicate, frankly, why you would not be that way for the next long-term, 10 years. Now it won\u2019t be 5% every year, obviously, we\u2019re not at 5% this year. But on the long-term, I still think that trend has not changed. Perfect. Thank you very much. Sure. Thank you. Our next question will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. Hock, I wanted to ask for your thoughts on capital allocation. It\u2019s been a while since your last meaningful acquisition. A lot of things are going on from a macro perspective. Rates are going up. And obviously, the economy is a little bit squishy. You just spent $2.7 billion on buybacks. Just curious how you\u2019re thinking about allocation of capital. Any changes to how you think about M&A and your appetite for M&A going forward? Thank you so much. Thank you. Well, really, in last quarter, we are very clear about our capital allocation plan, at least for 2022, and which is, frankly, at \u2013 we\u2019re still looking for acquisitions. We\u2019ve just been very, very \u2013 as we usually do, being very thoughtful and selective about the assets we would acquire. But very much so, we\u2019re still in the market to look for good \u2013 great assets to acquire, and we have the capacity to handle it. And in the meantime, given two years, 2020 and 2022 when we haven\u2019t done anything on acquisitions and have been earning and generating lots of cash, we have taken on \u2013 other than paying dividends and maintaining the policy on dividends that we have outlined for the long-term, we have decided for fiscal 2022 \u2013 for actually calendar 2022 to put out that buyback program of $10 billion. We spent $2.7 billion of it so far, and we have probably most of the year to", "doc_id": "70faad6b-05d4-43c4-9fbe-a56005592683", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "30699e1e144fd3f80a5b57361a699134ab5ae7b9ef8d4143ee3c90b5449f3f36", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 125530, "end": 129346, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96714939-cfe7-4621-b6aa-94fae9289ebf", "2": "31404d66-0f6d-4317-b39d-fc2577613a82", "3": "29e1410e-7c2b-4752-bba4-a7c062a196de"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "29e1410e-7c2b-4752-bba4-a7c062a196de": {"__data__": {"text": "$2.7 billion of it so far, and we have probably most of the year to go.

But \u2013 and we believe we still have the capacity to do a good-sized acquisition. Thank you so much. Thank you. Our next question will come from Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research. Please go ahead. Hi, thank you for taking my question. I\u2019d love to hear whatever debt you can give us, Hock, on your I think ASIC business in semiconductors. And what I\u2019m wondering is how is business trending compared to your other segments in semiconductors. And do you see your ASICs taking share overall with your hyperscale clients? Or is that just growing in line with the rest of the market or actually below the rest of the market? Okay. Let me paraphrase my \u2013 your question the way I would probably be able to answer it and see if it\u2019s the right thing. What you\u2019re saying is, see, we have a product division that does ASIC custom chips essentially for usually large customers. And that\u2019s a good-sized business for us. And a big part of that business to address what you\u2019re saying here, is address has been used is now currently, though not in the past, but more recently in the last few years, it was the hyperscale players who are starting to develop \u2013 wanting to develop their customized and dedicated accelerators for specific functions and workloads mostly related to, for instance, machine learning, AI, also to do with video transcoding and also gradually increasing virtualization and orchestration of data centers. All those have customized silicon accelerators to enable these hyper cloud guys to run their workloads better and more effectively. I believe that was your question. And the best way to answer your question is year-on-year this quarter, Q1, we grew revenue in this offload computing sector, which all ASIC north of 50% revenue year-upon-year. All right? I hope that answers your question. Yes. Thank you. That\u2019s perfect. Thank you so much. Thank you. Our next question will come from Tim Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead. Hi, thanks a lot. Hock, I had a question on your wireless business. It\u2019s been very strong, but you\u2019ve been recently talking about some trade-offs that one of your customers making is \u2013 making on the FBAR side, and maybe making it a little even more concentrated on a single customer. And I know that you consider selling this business some time back, but does even \u2013 your further revenue concentration, does it make you rethink maybe how committed you want to be to that segment? And maybe whether you could redeploy this capital into another market, especially as things might be changing on the modem side. Thank you. Okay. Good question. And my answer would be very simple and direct. We have always indicated our wireless business is one customer largely, our North American OEM. And you know what, they\u2019re a very good customer. They\u2019re very strategic. And we are not only selling one product but selling multiple products, which are very strategic to us and I believe also very important and strategic to them, which will \u2013 which is what makes a partnership very sustaining. I see this as a very long-term sustaining partnership in the sens, ['John Pitzer', 'Pierre Ferragu', 'Stacy Rasgon', 'Harlan Sur', 'Ross Seymore', 'Tim Arcuri', 'Ji Yoo', 'Hock Tan', 'Operator', 'Vivek Arya', 'Kirsten Spears', 'Toshiya Hari']\n4, CAT, 1, 2022, 2022-04-28 12:30:35, Welcome to the First Quarter 2022 Caterpillar Earnings Conference Call.

Joining me today are Jim Umpleby, Chairman and CEO; Andrew Bonfield, Chief Financial Officer; Kyle Epley, Vice President of the Global Finance Services Division; and Rob Rengel, Senior IR Manager. During our call today, we will be discussing the first quarter earnings release we issued earlier today. You can find our slides, the news release and a video recap at investors.caterpillar.com under Events and Presentations. I would also like to remind everyone that we are hosting Caterpillar\u2019s Investor Day on May 17 from 10:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central Time at the Hilton DFW Lakes Executive Conference Center in Grapevine, Texas. Our theme is services, technology and sustainability, helping our customers build a better world. Please check out the details on our investor website. Caterpillar has copyrighted this call and we prohibit use of any portion of it without our prior written approval. Moving to Slide 2. During our call today, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. We will also make assumptions that could cause our actual results to be different than the information we are sharing with you on this call. Please refer to our recent SEC filings and the forward-looking statements reminder in the news release for details on factors that individually or in aggregate could cause our actual results to vary materially from our forecast. On today\u2019s call, we will also refer to non-GAAP numbers. For a reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers to the appropriate U.S. GAAP numbers, please see the appendix of the earnings call slides. Today, we reported profit per share of $2.86 for the first quarter of 2022 compared with $2.77 of profit per share in the first quarter of 2021. We are including adjusted profit per share in addition to our U.S. GAAP results. Our adjusted profit per share was $2.88 for the first quarter of 2022 compared with adjusted profit per share of $2.87 for the first quarter of 2021. Adjusted profit per share for both quarters excluded restructuring costs. Now, let\u2019s flip to Slide 3 and turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Jim Umpleby. Thanks, Ryan. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I\u2019d like to start by thanking our global team for their contributions to another good quarter. We continue to execute our strategy for long-term profitable growth as demonstrated by our first quarter results. I will begin with my perspectives on our performance in the quarter and then I will provide some insight on our end markets. Before discussing our results, I\u2019d like to take a moment to say we remain deeply saddened by the tragic events continuing to occur in Ukraine and hope for a peaceful resolution. Through the Caterpillar Foundation, we have donated more than $1 million to support both urgent and long-term needs of the Ukraine humanitarian crisis. I am proud of our employees for their generous contributions through the Foundation Matching Gifts program, which added nearly an additional $1 million on support for Ukrainian refugees. On the operations front, we suspended production in our Russian manufacturing facilities and will continue to comply with all applicable laws and evolving sanctions. Moving on to our quarterly results, sales rose in all three of our primary segments due to volume gains and favorable price. Sales and margins were both slightly better than we expected. And similar to the second half of 2021, our top line would have been even stronger without the continuing supply chain constraints. Overall, we remain encouraged by the strong demand for our products and services. The first quarter of 2022 marked the fifth consecutive quarter of higher end user demand compared to the prior year. Services remained strong in the quarter. We continue to make progress on our service initiatives, including customer value agreements, e-commerce, connected assets and prioritized service events. Moving to Slide 4, sales and revenues increased by 14%, slightly better than we expected. The increase was primarily driven by higher end-user demand and the impact of changes in dealer inventories as well as strengthening price realization. The impact of our price actions started to accelerate in the second half of 2021.

We generated double-digit sales growth in all primary segments and sales rose in North America, Latin America and EAME. Asia-Pacific was down by 4%. Compared with the first quarter of 2021, sales to users rose 2%, which was about as we expected. For machines, including Construction Industries and Resource Industries, sales to users increased by 3%, while Energy & Transportation decreased 1%. Sales to users in Construction Industries were about flat overall with good growth globally in the first quarter, except for China. North America grew by double-digits as residential construction remained strong and non-residential contributed to show signs of improvement. Latin America saw higher end user demand supported by construction and strong commodity prices. End user demand increased in EAME due to residential growth and support of commodity prices. I will briefly discuss China. In the first quarter of 2021, China\u2019s greater than 10-ton excavator industry was at an all-time high, which resulted in a difficult comparable in the quarter. In the first quarter of 2022, China was lower than we expected due to weaker residential construction and COVID-19-related shutdowns. Overall, sales in China were about half the level we saw in the prior year\u2019s quarter. Keep in mind, China sales are typically 5% to 10% of our enterprise sales. Outside of China, Asia-Pacific sales to users grew as we continue to see strong demand in the region. In Resource Industries, the overall environment remained positive with sales to users up 13%, an improvement from the fourth quarter. Mining increased at a measured pace, which is in line with the expectations that we have been communicating to you for the last couple of years. Strong commodity prices supported a high utilization and a low number of parked trucks. In heavy construction and quarry and aggregates, sales to users increased versus the prior year for the fourth straight quarter as end user demand continues to improve. In Energy & Transportation, sales to users declined 1% versus the prior year. Solar turbines declined as expected due to the timing of projects. Excluding solar, sales to users were strong. Oil and gas sales to users were down in the first quarter with improvement in reciprocating engines more than offset by solar. Despite continued data center and rental demand strength, power generation sales to users were down overall due to timing of some larger projects. Industrial end user demand strengthened across all regions. Lastly, Transportation benefited from growth off a low base, primarily in marine applications. Now, I will spend a moment on dealer inventory. Dealers who are independent businesses increased their inventories by about $1.3 billion in the first quarter. This compares to a $700 million increase in the first quarter of last year. While dealer inventories remain near the low end of the typical range, we continue to work closely with dealers to satisfy higher end user demand. Andrew will provide additional color about dealer inventory later in the call. Regarding ongoing supply constraints, we experienced similar challenges to what we highlighted in the fourth quarter, which was in line with our expectations. We continue to experience constraints with semiconductors and certain other components. Our team continues to implement solutions to help mitigate the overall situation. For example, we executed engineering redesigns to provide customers with alternative options. We also increased dual sourcing of components and placed specialized Caterpillar resources at suppliers to help ease constraints. I remain proud of our global team\u2019s ability to deliver double-digit sales growth despite supply chain challenges. Similar to previous quarters, absent the supply chain constraints, our top line would have been even stronger. When the supply chain conditions ease, we expect to be well positioned to fully meet demand and gain operating leverage from higher volumes. Operating profit increased 2% in the quarter to $1.9 billion driven by strong volume and favorable price realization across all segments, which was partially offset by higher manufacturing cost and SG&A and R&D expenses. The higher manufacturing costs primarily reflected increased material and freight", "doc_id": "450ac152-434e-4ff8-b94e-4b1fcb98f4e9", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "03d780ff5c4609d451bf8f30e45132eb9c1c2fcd25f7740693844b5b77822b00", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 137576, "end": 141935, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96714939-cfe7-4621-b6aa-94fae9289ebf", "2": "b803ad4a-792c-4355-b5a6-dca9433d97ec", "3": "0a064ce1-7fcb-4e87-87a4-9aa3df74bd78"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "0a064ce1-7fcb-4e87-87a4-9aa3df74bd78": {"__data__": {"text": "expenses. The higher manufacturing costs primarily reflected increased material and freight costs in the quarter. While we did see some labor inefficiencies, these were not as significant as they were in the fourth quarter. Operating profit margins were 13.7% in the first quarter, which was lower than the first quarter of 2021. We expect that comparisons would be difficult as inflationary impacts to manufacturing costs accelerated in the back half of 2021 and remained at a similar level in the first quarter of 2022. On a sequential basis, our margins improved versus the fourth quarter as we expected. Our profit per share was $2.86 versus $2.77 in the first quarter of 2021. The adjusted profit per share was $2.88 versus $2.87 in the first quarter of last year. On Slide 5, we had an ME&T free cash outflow of about $400 million in the quarter, which Andrew will discuss in a few moments. To remind you, our Investor Day target is to deliver ME&T free cash flow of between $4 billion and $8 billion per year. We expect to be within that range for the full year 2022. Regarding capital deployment, we completed $800 million of share repurchases and returned $600 million in dividends to shareholders. We remain proud of our dividend aristocrat status. We continue to expect to return substantially all of our ME&T free cash flow to shareholders over time through dividends and share repurchases. Now, I will share some high level assumptions on our expectations for the full year. We expect to achieve our Investor Day targets for adjusted operating profit margins and as I have just mentioned, deliver ME&T free cash flow within our targeted range in 2022. As I previously indicated, we continue to be encouraged by strong order demand across our segments. In the first quarter of 2022, our total backlog increased by $3.4 billion as we experienced continued strong demand and supply chain challenges. Backlog increased in all segments with the largest increase in Energy & Transportation. The environment continues to be challenging due to supply chain constraints and the more recent COVID-19-related shutdowns in China. Although manufacturing costs are expected to remain elevated, we expect price to more than offset these cost increases for the full year. Turning to Slide 6, I will discuss our expectations for key end markets this year. In Construction Industries in North America, residential construction remained strong with non-residential continuing to improve. Despite rising interest rates, infrastructure investment is expected to improve in late 2022 and beyond supported by the U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The 10-ton and above excavator market in China was very strong in 2020 and 2021. We now anticipate this market will be slightly lower than 2019 levels. The rest of Asia-Pacific region is expected to grow due to higher infrastructure spending. In the EAME, despite the broader geopolitical concerns, we remain cautiously optimistic due to housing growth in the EU investment package that is expected to drive construction demand. Construction and mining activity in Latin America are supportive of growth that could be impacted by inflation and interest rate policy decisions. In Resource Industries, we believe commodity prices will continue to drive higher production and utilization levels, which support more investments in equipment and services in 2022 and beyond. Within heavy construction and quarry and aggregates, we also anticipate continued growth in 2022. Lastly, we are seeing increased quoting for our autonomous solutions, which includes large mining trucks, drills, track-type tractors, water trucks and underground machines. In Energy & Transportation, we expect improving momentum in 2022 with strong order rates in most applications. In oil and gas, although customers remain disciplined, we are encouraged by continued strength in reciprocated engine orders, especially for large engine replacements as asset utilization increases.

In rail, North American locomotive sales are expected to remain muted, but international locomotives are more promising. We also anticipate growth in high-speed marine as customers upgrade aging fleets. Now on to Slide 7. In 2021 and into the first quarter of 2022, Caterpillar and our customers announced a number of projects that will contribute to a reduced carbon future. We recently entered into an agreement with ioneer, a U.S.-based lithium Boron miner. This will be the first Greenfield site in the U.S. to use autonomous haul trucks. Lithium is a key component for electric \u2013 for battery electric vehicles and the minerals from this Nevada mine will help contribute to a more sustainable future. Our autonomous technology is a competitive advantage as it delivers significant benefits to our customers, including improved safety, productivity and efficiency, while lowering greenhouse gas emissions per ton of material removed. Our commitment to sustainable innovation remains strong as we continue to execute our strategy for long-term profitable growth. I look forward to hosting you at our Investor Day on May 17, where we will be talking more about services, technology and sustainability. With that, I will turn the call over to Andrew. Thank you, Jim and good morning everyone. I will begin with a recap of our first quarter results, including the performance of our segments. Then I will comment on the balance sheet and free cash flow before concluding with a few comments on our expectations as we move into the second quarter of 2022. Beginning on Slide 8, sales and revenues for the first quarter increased by 14% or $1.7 billion to $13.6 billion. Volume, including higher dealer inventory build and price drove the increase in sales and revenues, which as Jim mentioned was slightly better than we had expected. Operating profit increased by 2% to $1.9 billion as price realization and volume growth were partially offset by higher manufacturing and period costs. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 13.7% was slightly better than we had anticipated primarily due to the stronger-than-expected volumes and favorable price realization. First quarter profit per share was $2.86 compared to $2.77 in the prior year. Adjusted profit per share was $2.88 in the first quarter compared to $2.87 last year. Adjusted profit per share for both quarters excludes restructuring costs. Our global tax rate in the quarter was about 24%, slightly lower than we had guided you in January. However, on a comparable basis, the lower tax rate was offset by lower favorable discrete tax benefits compared to the prior year. Now on Slide 9, as we anticipated, top line improved on stronger volume and price realization. End user demand increased versus the prior year, but the growth rate accelerated on a sequential basis due to tougher comparisons, especially in China. Dealer inventory rose by about $1.3 billion. Services revenues remained strong in the quarter. Price realization strengthened, while currency was a bit of a headwind. Let me provide some color on dealer inventory. The $1.3 billion increase versus year end 2021 was nearly double what we had anticipated and about $600 million more than the increase we saw in the same quarter last year. About half of that $600 million increase year-on-year came from Resource Industries due to the timing of shipments from our dealers to their customers, which can be lumpy. These units are backed by firm customer orders, but were not recognized in our reported retail sales for the quarter. This is in part due to variations in onsite assembly times. The other half of the deal inventory increase was mainly due to the timing of shipments in Construction Industries late in the quarter. We anticipate that dealers will start to sell down the inventories in the second quarter following their normal seasonable pattern on strong sales to users. Our expectations for the full year haven\u2019t changed and we do not expect to see a significant benefit from dealer restocking in 2022 as end-user demand remains strong.", "doc_id": "1f49fc63-c3bd-43d2-abd1-a581ef2737a7", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "87d5602c2940f19c9284534e3f5ad4123281165eb411f5debe1daca19606bbed", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 146286, "end": 150619, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96714939-cfe7-4621-b6aa-94fae9289ebf", "2": "0a064ce1-7fcb-4e87-87a4-9aa3df74bd78", "3": "32a3dec8-db8d-4870-a040-c57d38d69238"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "32a3dec8-db8d-4870-a040-c57d38d69238": {"__data__": {"text": "a significant benefit from dealer restocking in 2022 as end-user demand remains strong. First quarter sales and revenues increased by double-digit percentages in all regions, except Asia-Pacific. Sales in North America rose by 23% with continued growth in the three primary segments. In EAME, sales increased by 15%, while Latin America sales grew by 26%, a 4% decrease in Asia-Pacific sales was primarily due to softening in China. Sales in the remainder of that region were positive. Moving to Slide 10. As I mentioned, first quarter operating profit increased by 2% on favorable price and volume. Price realization was slightly better than we had anticipated. Manufacturing costs remain elevated, but in line with our expectations primarily due to continued material and freight cost headwinds. SG&A and costs increased partly due to investments in services and technologies such as digital, autonomy and electrification. Our first quarter adjusted operating profit margin was 13.7%, a 210 basis point decrease versus the prior year. As we said in our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call, we expected the largest margin headwinds to occur in the first quarter. First quarter margins were lower than the prior year. Favorable price realization did not offset higher manufacturing costs, but did improve compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Margins were slightly better than we had anticipated on stronger price and volume partially offset by higher than expected short-term incentive compensation. I will discuss our expectations for the second quarter and full year margins in a bit more detail later. Moving to Slide 11, let\u2019s review segment performance starting with Construction Industries. Sales increased by 12% in the first quarter to $6.1 billion primarily driven by favorable price realization and strong sales volume. End-user demand improved in three of the four regions. North America had the highest sales growth in sales dollars, a 28% increase, as non-residential demand improved and residential construction remains strong. Sales in Latin America increased by 60% as construction activity supported higher demand, EAME sales increased by 18% primarily due to growth in residential construction demand. However, Asia-Pacific sales decreased by 21% due to a reduction in sales in China, which had a very strong quarter a year ago. The segment\u2019s first quarter profit increased by 1% versus the prior year to $1.1 billion. Price realization and higher sales volume drove the increase more than offsetting increases in manufacturing costs. Price realization was stronger than we had anticipated but lagged manufacturing costs in the quarter. The segment\u2019s operating margin decreased by 180 basis points to 17.3%. Turning to Slide 12. Resource Industries sales increased by 30% in the first quarter to $2.8 billion. The improvement was mostly due to higher end-user demand, the impact from changes in dealer inventories and favorable price. End-user demand increased in heavy construction and quarrying aggregates as well as mining. First quarter profit for Resource Industries increased by 16% to $361 million. Higher sales volume and favorable price realization were partially offset by higher manufacturing costs and increases in SG&A and R&D expenses. Manufacturing cost increases were primarily due to freight and material. The segment\u2019s operating margin decreased by 150 basis points versus last year to 12.8%. Now on Slide 13. Energy & Transportation sales increased by 12% to approximately $5 billion with sales up across all applications. This included a 4% sales increase in oil and gas, including aftermarket parts for reciprocating engines. Power generation sales increased by 5%. Small reciprocating engine sales improved. Solar turbine sales were lower in the quarter for oil and gas and power generation applications, impacted by a higher-than-usual first quarter in 2021. Industrial sales rose by 25%, with strength across all regions. Finally, transportation increased by 9% on reciprocating engine cells for both aftermarket parts and marine applications. Profit for Energy & Transportation decreased by 20% to $538 million. Higher sales volume and price realization were more than offset by higher manufacturing costs, reflecting continued headwinds from freighter material.

In addition, SG&A and R&D expenses increased. The segment\u2019s operating margin decreased by 430 basis points versus last year to 10.7%. Let me take a moment to provide a bit more color on Energy & Transportation margins. Seasonally, first quarter margins are typically lower compared to the rest of the year in this segment. However, the first quarter of 2022 proved a bit more challenging due to continued supply chain constraints, including elevated freight and material costs. I\u2019ll discuss very generally, but note that increased freight costs have impacted this segment more than others. Also, Energy & Transportation took price increases later in the year 2021 given the different marketing dynamics as compared to the other primary segments. However, similar to the other segments, we expect margins to improve through 2022 as the benefit of higher price realization starts to pull through. Moving to Slide 14. Financial Products had another good quarter. Revenue increased by 3% to $783 million. Segment profit decreased by 2% to $238 million. Whilst profit was down, this represents our second highest first quarter profit in 8 years. The decrease was mainly due to a higher provision for credit losses at Cat Financial related to reserves associated with Russia and Ukraine. Note, the Russian-Ukraine generally accounts for about 2% of Caterpillar\u2019s enterprise sales and less than 1% of the Cat Financial portfolio. Demand for used equipment remained very strong in the quarter, and that helped mitigate the impact of higher provisions. Moving to our credit portfolio. It remains high quality as customers and dealers continue to perform well in the quarter. Past dues were 2.05%, the best first quarter performance we\u2019ve seen in 15 years. That\u2019s down 85 basis points year-over-year and up just 10 basis points compared to the fourth quarter, which had marked a 15-year low. While new business volume typically decreased versus the fourth quarter, this is typical seasonality. New business volume was our second highest first quarter performance in 8 years, second only to the prior year, which benefited from pent-up demand following COVID-related shutdowns. Regarding interest rate changes, we are in a good position as our matched funding strategy serves to mitigate that risk. We also maintained healthy spreads on new business. Now on Slide 15. We had an ME&T free cash outflow of about $400 million, a decrease of $2.1 billion versus the first quarter of 2021. Let me take a moment to discuss the changes. In a typical year, the first quarter is our weakest from a cash generation perspective, primarily due to the payment of our incentives. We paid approximately $1.3 billion in short-term incentive compensation during the first quarter compared to zero in the prior year. This accounts for the majority of the difference year-over-year. In addition, we continue to build production inventory in the quarter by about $1 billion, which contributed to a negative net working capital impact of approximately $600 million. Despite these first quarter impacts, we continue to expect to achieve our Investor Day free cash flow target of between $4 billion and $8 billion for the full year. Moving to shareholder return. We paid around $600 million in dividends during the first quarter. We also repurchased about $800 million worth of common stock supporting our objective to be in the market on a more consistent basis. Enterprise cash was $6.5 billion, a $2.7 billion decrease compared to the year-end. The $400 million free cash outflow and the $1.4 billion in shareholder returns accounted for the majority of the decrease in our cash position. In addition, we have moved some of our cash balances into slightly longer-dated liquid marketable securities in order to improve the yield on that cash. This amounted to about $800 million in the quarter. Now on Slide 16. In light of the current environment, including supply chain constraints, we continue to refrain from providing annual profit per share guidance. However, I do want to share some thoughts on the second quarter and the full year. The first quarter played out slightly better than we had anticipated on the top line, resulting from higher volume and", "doc_id": "4df76bd8-6fc3-4bf4-b635-9fc298c72ba2", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "53d85d8d5f203a18ae730c4078b58eb9f830a5efefcd751751d5f14c85bc5d8c", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 154917, "end": 159230, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96714939-cfe7-4621-b6aa-94fae9289ebf", "2": "32a3dec8-db8d-4870-a040-c57d38d69238", "3": "fdf9d98d-ee4c-4bf8-9872-56ccfa9a069b"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "fdf9d98d-ee4c-4bf8-9872-56ccfa9a069b": {"__data__": {"text": "played out slightly better than we had anticipated on the top line, resulting from higher volume and better-than-expected price tailwinds. Supply chain challenges remained steady, which we expect to continue into the second quarter. Despite these challenges, we anticipate the top line will increase compared to the first quarter and continued strong end user demand and favorable price realization. Looking to the remainder of the year, our order books and backlog remain robust. We expect continued strong end-user demand and pricing, although supply chain challenges will impact the extent to which we will be able to fully meet demand. As I mentioned, we do not expect to see a significant benefit from dealer restocking in 2022. On margins, as we discussed in January, we do not expect a typical year. In a normal year, we\u2019d see strong margins in the first quarter with margins decreasing sequentially through the fourth quarter. However, this year, we expect margins to improve in the second half of the year compared to both the first half and the comparable period of 2021 as the impact of price actions accelerate. Comparisons ease in the back half of the year as well as we let the manufacturing cost increases from the prior year. As Jim mentioned, we continue to expect price to more than offset manufacturing costs for the full year. Specific to the second quarter, we expect similar margins to the prior year as additional price actions should offset manufacturing cost increases. Looking at the second quarter by segment. We do expect margins in both Construction Industries and Resource Industries to be close to or higher than the prior year as price improves and manufacturing cost headwinds are in line with the first quarter. Margin in Energy & Transportation still lag the prior year as the timing of price actions is late as compared to the other segments. However, we expect the lag in the second quarter was not \u2013 will not be as significant as it was in the first quarter. As we move into the second half of the year in Energy & Transportation, we expect a reduction in expediting costs and an improvement in efficiencies. Increases in large engine and turbine volumes versus 2021 should also positively contribute to margins in the second half of the year. However, it\u2019s important to note that the majority of our core investments related to the energy transition will impact this segment. Finally, to assist with more modeling, we currently expect to add accrual for short-term incentive compensation expense to be around $1.3 billion this year. We anticipate a global effective tax rate of around 24% and restructuring costs of approximately $600 million for the full year. Turning to Slide 17. In summary, we performed well in a challenging environment. End-user demand remains strong, and we realized $1.7 billion more in revenues. Sales and margins were slightly better than we expected. Looking ahead, comparisons ease in the second half of the year, and we expect to achieve our Investor Day targets of adjusted operating profit margins and ME&T free cash flow. And with that, we will take your questions.  Your first question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is now open. Thanks and good morning, everyone. Good morning, Rob. Good morning, Rob. If I have it right, I think your backlog increased by the most in a decade, maybe one of the couple of best order quarters \u2013 implied order quarters you\u2019ve had. And obviously, there is some moving parts you guys addressed the fact that you\u2019d like to ship a little bit more. I don\u2019t know if you can quantify that. I know you\u2019ve done a lot of work with dealers, helping them forecast to get the right levels of inventory rather than too much or too little. I don\u2019t know whether you can sort of give context around that backlog increase, how much more you would have liked to ship. Does dealer optimism drive a lot of it? Or is it really end user demand? Anything you can say to help us out? Thank you. Thanks for your question, Rob. So just in terms of the backlog, the largest backlog increase was actually in Energy & Transportation and as orders continue to strengthen for both solar and for recip oil and gas. And as you know, those products tend to have longer lead times. Having said that, we are", "doc_id": "fdf9d98d-ee4c-4bf8-9872-56ccfa9a069b", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "cf66dbf053f1cf0b10f3c4df4d9ad70b37e66b0c1887d51f771fd45c4d1bc5f0", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 159226, "end": 163540, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96714939-cfe7-4621-b6aa-94fae9289ebf", "2": "4df76bd8-6fc3-4bf4-b635-9fc298c72ba2", "3": "a8ac9fa7-0d7c-485f-af54-0e8e94affc63"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "a8ac9fa7-0d7c-485f-af54-0e8e94affc63": {"__data__": {"text": "you know, those products tend to have longer lead times. Having said that, we are certainly working with our dealers to help them satisfy end-user demand. We do have a new S&OP process, and we do feel good about the quality of the orders that we\u2019re getting in E&T and RI, again, which tend to have some of those longer lead times. So again, just a real positive backdrop moving forward. Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Hi, good morning and nice quarter. Thanks, Jamie. Jim, I guess my question, I\u2019ll direct it towards you because it\u2019s with regards to the E&T and you used to run that business. So can you help me understand \u2013 the top line was a little lighter than I would have thought. What are you hearing from your oil and gas customers? And how does that impact the trajectory of growth for E&T this year? And then I guess, on the margin side, I understand the puts and takes with solar and pricing having to come through an investment. But is there any way you can help us with how to think about sort of E&T margins as we exit the year, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s investment \u2013 some of the investments you\u2019re making will sort of create pressure on margins, I guess, over the longer term, so, thank you. You bet. Oil and gas customers do continue to display capital discipline. However, we are encouraged by the improvement in orders for both recip and solar. As I mentioned earlier, those products tend to have longer lead times. Higher oil prices are leading to increased utilization and refurbishment of frac assets, and it\u2019s an improved opportunity for pump and flow iron as well. Then in terms of your question around margins, as you can imagine, as volume increases in solar and oil and gas, that will help. Also, we\u2019ve mentioned previously that we took price action in Energy & Transportation around engines later than we did machines. And as those price actions continue to take effect that will also help margins as we move throughout the year. So no structural headwind to margins. Again, certainly, we\u2019re making investments in sustainability and some of the things we\u2019re doing there around alternative drivetrains. So we\u2019re making those investments. But again, the other side of it is, of course, improving volume and price. Okay, thank you. And as I indicated, Jamie, we would expect just the same for the other segment\u2019s margins to improve in the second half of the year in Energy & Transportation. Okay, thanks., ['Jim Umpleby', 'Ryan Fiedler', 'Operator', 'Jamie Cook', 'Andrew Bonfield', 'Rob Wertheimer']\n5, JPM, 1, 2022, 2022-04-13 12:13:07, Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please standby. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead. Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on page 1. The firm reported net income of $8.3 billion, EPS of $2.63 on revenue of $31.6 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 16%. These results include approximately $900 million of credit reserve builds, which I'll cover in more detail shortly, as well as $500 million of losses in Credit Adjustments & Other in CIB. Regarding loan growth, we're continuing to see positive trends with loans up 8% year-on-year and 1% quarter-on-quarter ex PPP with the sequential growth driven by a continued pickup in demand in our Wholesale businesses, including ongoing strength in AWM. On page 2, we have some more detail on our results. Revenue of $31.6 billion was down $1.5 billion or 5% year-on-year.

NII ex Markets was up $1 billion or 9% on balance sheet growth and higher rates, partially offset by lower NII from PPP loans. NIR ex Markets was down $2.2 billion or 17% predominantly driven by lower IB fees, lower Home Lending production revenue, losses in Credit Adjustments & Other in CIB as well as investment securities losses in corporate. And Markets revenue was down $300 million or 3% against a record first quarter last year. Expenses of $19.2 billion were up approximately $500 million or 2%, predominantly on higher investments and structural expenses, largely offset by lower volume and revenue-related expenses. Credit costs were $1.5 billion for the quarter. We built $902 million in reserves driven by increasing the probability of downside risks due to high inflation and the war in Ukraine as well as builds for Russia-associated exposures in CIB and AWM. Net charge-offs of $582 million were down year-on-year and comparable to last quarter and remain historically low across our portfolios. On to balance sheet and capital on page 3. Our CET1 ratio ended at 11.9%, down 120 basis points from the prior quarter. As a reminder, we exited the fourth quarter with an elevated buffer to absorb anticipated changes this quarter, the largest being SA-CCR adoption as well as some pickup in seasonal activity. In addition to those anticipated items, there were a couple of other drivers. The rate sell-off led to AOCI drawdowns in our AFS portfolio. But keep in mind, all else equal, these mark-to-market losses accrete back to capital through time and as securities mature. And price increases across commodities resulted in higher counterparty credit and market risk RWA. While, of course, the environment is uncertain, many of these effects are now in the rearview mirror. And as a result, we believe that our current capital and future earnings profile position us well to continue supporting business growth while meeting increasing capital requirements as we look ahead. With that, let's go to our businesses, starting with Consumer & Community Banking on page 4. CCB reported net income of $2.9 billion on revenue of $12.2 billion, which was down 2% year-on-year. In Consumer & Business Banking, revenue was up 8%, predominantly driven by growth in deposit balances and client investment assets, partially offset by deposit margin compression. Deposits were up 18% year-on-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter, consistent with last quarter. And client investment assets were up 9% year-on-year, largely driven by flows in addition to market performance. In Home Lending, revenue was down 20% year-on-year on lower production revenue from both, lower margins and volumes against a very strong quarter last year, largely offset by higher net servicing revenue. Originations of $24.7 billion declined 37% with the rise in rates. And as a result, mortgage loans were down 3%. Moving to Card & Auto. Revenue was down 8% year-on-year, primarily on strong new card account originations, leading to higher acquisition costs. Card outstandings were up 11%, and revolving balances have continued to grow, ending the quarter above the first quarter of '21 levels. And in Auto, originations were $8.4 billion, down 25% due to the lack of vehicle supply, while loans were up 3%. Touching on consumer spend. Combined credit and debit spend was up 21% year-on-year with growth stronger in credit as we see a continued pickup in travel and dining. And as the quarter progressed, we saw a robust reacceleration of T&E spend, up 64%. Expenses of $7.7 billion were up 7% year-on-year, driven by higher investments and structural expenses, partially offset by lower volume and revenue-related expenses. Next, the CIB on page 5. CIB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $13.5 billion for the first quarter. Investment Banking revenue of $2.1 billion was down 28% versus the prior year.

In Advisory, fees were up 18%, and it was the best first quarter ever, benefiting from the closing of deals announced in 2021. Debt underwriting fees were down 20% primarily driven by leverage finance as issuers contended with market volatility. And in equity underwriting, fees were down 76% on lower issuance activity, particularly in North America and EMEA. Moving to Markets. Total revenue was $8.8 billion, down 3% against a record first quarter last year. Fixed income was relatively flat driven by a decline in securitized products, where rising rates have slowed down the pace of mortgage production, largely offset by growth in currencies and emerging markets and commodities on elevated client activity in a volatile market. Equity markets were down 7% against an all-time record quarter last year. This quarter, however, was our second best with robust client activity across both, derivatives and cash. And prime continued to perform well with client balances hovering around all-time highs. Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $524 million, driven by funding spread widening as well as credit valuation adjustments relating to both, increases in commodities exposures and markdowns of derivatives receivables from Russia-associated counterparties. Let me take a second here to address the widely reported situation in the nickel market as it relates to our results this quarter. We were hedging positions for clients closely linked to nickel producers, who generally sell forward a portion of the coming year's production. The extreme price movements created margin calls, which we and other banks are helping to address. Because this is counterparty related, not trading, it appears in the Credit Adjustments & Other line, where it contributed about $120 million to the reported loss I just mentioned. It also drove approximately half of the increase in market risk RWA that I noted on the capital slide and was a driver of higher reported VaR, which will also be elevated in our upcoming filings. Payments revenue was $1.9 billion, up 33% year-on-year or up 9% excluding net gains on equity investments, driven by continued growth in fees, deposit balances and higher rates. Securities Services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 2% year-on-year, driven by higher rates and growth in fees. Expenses of $7.3 billion were up 3% year-on-year, mostly due to higher structural expenses and investments, largely offset by lower volume and revenue-related expenses. Moving to Commercial Banking on page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $850 million and an ROE of 13%. Revenue of $2.4 billion was flat year-on-year with higher payments revenue and deposit balances, offset by lower Investment Banking revenue. Gross Investment Banking revenue of $729 million was down 35%, driven by both, fewer large deals and less flow activity. Expenses of $1.1 billion were up 17% year-on-year, largely driven by investments in volume and revenue-related expenses. Deposits were down 2% quarter-on-quarter as client balances are seasonally highest at year-end. Loans were up 5% year-on-year and up 3% quarter-on-quarter, excluding PPP. C&I loans were up 3% sequentially ex PPP, reflecting higher revolver utilization and originations across Middle Market and Corporate Client Banking. CRE loans were up 3%, driven by strong loan originations and funding across the portfolio. And then, to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1 billion with a pretax margin of 30%. Revenue of $4.3 billion was up 6% year-on-year as growth in deposits and loans and higher management fees and performance fees and alternative investments were partially offset by deposit margin compression and the absence of investment valuation gains from the prior year. Expenses of $2.9 billion were up 11% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher structural expenses and investments as well as higher volume and revenue-related expenses. For the quarter, net long-term inflows of $19 billion were positive across all channels with strength in equities, multi-asset and alternatives.

And finally, loans were up 3% quarter-on-quarter with continued strength in mortgages and securities-based lending, while deposits were up 9%. Turning to Corporate on page 8. Corporate reported a net loss of $856 million. Revenue was a loss of $881 million, down $408 million year-on-year. NII was up $319 million due to the impact of higher rates, and NIR was down $727 million due to losses on legacy equity investments versus gains last year as well as approximately $400 million of net realized losses on investment securities this quarter. Expenses of $184 million were lower by $692 million year-on-year primarily due to the contribution to the firm's foundation in the prior year. Next, the outlook on page 9. We still expect NII ex Markets to be in excess of $53 billion and adjusted expenses to be approximately $77 billion. And we'll update these and give you more color at Investor Day next month. So to wrap up, once again, this quarter, the Company's performance was strong in a particularly volatile and challenging environment. We helped our clients navigate very difficult markets, provided support to relief efforts and implemented economic sanctions of unprecedented complexity with multiple directives from governments around the world. And of course, our thoughts remain with everyone, including our employees affected by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Looking ahead, the U.S. economy remains robust, but we're watching high inflation, the reversal of QE and rising rates as well as the ongoing effects of the war on the global economy. With that, operator, please open the line for Q&A. And our first question is coming from John McDonald from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good morning, Jeremy. I was wondering about the net interest income outlook. I know it sounds like we'll get more at Investor Day, but it's very similar to what you gave in mid-February. And obviously, rate expectations have advanced since then. Could you give us a little bit of color on what kind of assumptions are underlying the net interest income ex Markets outlook? Yes. Good morning, John, good question. And yes, look, obviously, given what's happened in terms of Fed hike expectations and what's getting questioned into the front of the curve, we would actually expect the access part of in excess of $53 billion to be bigger than it was at Credit Suisse. So, to size that, probably a couple million dollars. But we don't want to get too precise at this point. We want to run our bottoms-up process. We -- there have been very big moves, and we want to get it right. And so, we'll give more detail about that at Investor Day. Okay. And as my follow-up, could you give us some thoughts about the Markets-related NII? What things should we think about there, whether it's seasonality or how it's affected by rising rates? Yes. I guess, I would direct you to my comments, I think, one or two quarters ago on this. But generally speaking, that number is pretty correlated to the short-term rate. So, all else equal, you'll see a headwind in there as the Fed hikes come through, which, in general, in the geography, we would tend to expect that to be offset in NIR. But it's noisy. It can shift as a function of obscure balance sheet composition issues, as I've mentioned in the past. And so, that's why we don't focus too much on that number. The next question is coming from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Jeremy, I just wanted to follow up on your comments about capital and being able to provide room for organic growth. With a 5.2% SLR, 11.9% CET1 versus your longer-term targets, can you talk about what that means in terms of the buyback potential from here? And do any of the RWA inflation items come back off that you just saw in the first quarter?

Thanks. Yes, thanks. So, let me just give some high-level comments about the CET1 trajectory and so on. So, as you know, we went into the quarter with elevated buffers, knowing that we would have denominator growth as a result of the adoption of SA-CCR. And so, of course, that happened. And we would have expected roughly to be 12.5 right in the middle of the range this quarter. Of course, it was an unusual quarter in a number of ways. And so, we saw RWA inflation from market risk, which we've talked about and the AOCI drawdown and a number of other slightly smaller factors producing the 11.9%. From where we sit here, to your point, a number of these items are, in fact, going to bleed back in relatively quickly, some faster than others. So, we would expect a significant portion of the RWA inflation to bleed out, obviously, to decay out. The AOCI drawdown will obviously come back over time. And probably most importantly, to the prior question, the higher rate outlook is improving the revenue outlook, which will, of course, accrete to capital. So then, if you line that up against the sort of rising minimums, of course, we have the increase in the G-SIB requirement in the first quarter of '23 coming in. And then, there's a question of SCB, where we don't know, obviously, but given the countercyclical nature of the stress and the fact that the unemployment launch point is a lot lower and that the unemployment rate is floored in the Fed scenario, you might expect SCB to be a little bit higher when it's published in June, effective in the fourth quarter. But that gives us time to make any adjustments that we need to make. So, I guess, to summarize, when we put all this together, between improved income generation, some of the denominator to KFX and the various levers that we have available to pull across the dimension of time as soon information comes into play, we really feel quite good about our capital position from here and the trajectory as we look forward and minimums evolve. And just a follow-up there, too. Is there anything you need to consider structurally in terms of like adding preferreds to help bridge the gap, or is it just going to be enough to organically build back with possibly just utilizing less buyback to allow things to just grow back? Yes. I think, the -- I guess, in general, we haven't wanted to say a lot publicly about our preferred actions. As you know, some of these instruments are callable. And we have choices to make about whether or not we call them to adjust to different situations. So I think that's an example of the types of levers that we have available to pull as the environment evolves. But from where we sit today with the numbers that I'm looking at, we have a pretty clean trajectory to get to where we want to be. The next one is coming from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. I had a question for Jamie. In your annual letter, you mentioned how you expect to achieve double-digit market share over time in payments. And what I wanted to understand is if you could unpack that a little bit because when I look at payments, you've got a lot of different sleeves. For example, in consumer credit card, you're at 20%, 25%. In treasury, I think you're at 7%. So, could you give us a sense as to where you think you are in this total payments category you're talking about, what you're expecting in terms of drivers to get to double digit and what kind of time frame you're thinking about there? Thanks. Yes. So yes, Betsy, so that number, the double-digit relating just to Wholesale Payments, not to consumer payments, which obviously, we already have a fairly significant share. And we've gone from 4.5% to something a little bit north of 7% over the last five years. And we're just building out. And I gave some examples and I\u2019d give a lot and then you have Investor Day coming up, we're building all the things we need, real-time payments, certain blockchain-type things.

So, it's kind of across the board. It's nothing mystical about it, but it's an area we want to win in. Okay. And getting to double digits is over the same kind of time frame with the same pace going from 4 to 7, or do you think you can accelerate that? Because I see what... I wasn't meaning to put a time frame on it, but I would say five years. You'll get more update on this at Investor Day. Okay. And then, just a follow-up here is on the NII outlook, where you indicated the curve suggests the plus side and is it a couple of billion. And I guess the question I have is historically, you've been looking to reinvest that benefit from rising rates. You did that last cycle as well. What I hear -- what I'm hearing is that maybe you don't want to size it for us right now today because you plan on investing it and explaining that at Investor Day. Is that a fair takeaway? No, no, no. We don't look at that way like we're reinvesting NII. We -- the investing stuff, we look at all the time we're investing, and we're investing a lot of money for the future kind of across the board. But that's not why you're saying... I mean, I think fundamentally, we have had confidence in delivering our 17% ROTCE through the cycle. We talked a little bit over the last couple of quarters about at the time, some short-term headwinds to that, mostly as a function of the rate environment and a couple of other things. The investment plan is a strategic plan that recognizes that sort of confidence in the 17%. The fact that that moment may be getting pulled forward as a result of the Fed's reaction to the economy has no impact on how we think about spending. The next question is coming from Steve Chubak from Wolfe Research. So, I wanted to start off with a question on QT. In the past, you've spoken about the linkage between Fed balance sheet reduction and deposit outflow expectation for yourselves in the industry. And with the Fed just outlining a more aggressive glide path per balance sheet reduction, how should we be thinking about deposit outflow risk? Any views on how betas may differ versus last cycle, given a more aggressive pace of Fed timing? Hey Steve, so this is a fun question. So, let's nerd out a little bit. I'm sure Jamie will jump in. So look, I think we've talked a little bit about what happened in the prior cycle, right? So, you had QE, and then you had big expansion in bank deposits, system-wide expansion. And at the tail end of that cycle, you had RRP come in, and then RRP has gotten sort of quite big as QE finished. And so now, as you look at potentially kind of running that whole thing in reverse, you might actually expect that the first thing that would happen is that RRP would get drained and only later would bank deposits start to shrink. But I think you correctly point out some of the nuances in the Fed minutes. And when you sort of combine all the effects together, you realize that there's a lot of interacting forces here and is really, I think, very intelligent people differ on their predictions about what's going to happen here. And just to outline a couple of those. So, it's worth noting for starters that in general, industry-wide loan growth outlook is quite robust, and that should be a tailwind for system-wide deposit growth. So, as you noted, yes, QT will start in May in all likelihood for the minutes headwind. Then, you just have to look at what's going to happen in the front end of the curve, particularly in bills. So, the treasury has to make decisions about weighted average maturity and what makes sense there. There's obviously a little bit of shortage of short-dated collateral in the market right now. So, that might argue for wanting more supply there. The Fed has to make decisions about portfolio management. They talked in the minutes about using bill", "doc_id": "502f2c99-e416-4592-94a6-ec1f5ff31eda", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "233fa2c270449faacd679f45380a87fe73c29dca4c61e45e7097c5b6c752a8ae", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 183856, "end": 187921, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96714939-cfe7-4621-b6aa-94fae9289ebf", "2": "c130ad86-affb-4f5c-826b-2700b48154b9", "3": "74814759-2856-466f-9383-ce8c3d83906b"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "74814759-2856-466f-9383-ce8c3d83906b": {"__data__": {"text": "has to make decisions about portfolio management. They talked in the minutes about using bill maturities to fill in gaps and so on and so forth. And so, those things are going to interact in various ways. I think, one thing that's worth noting though is that if you wind up in the state of the world where bank deposits drain sooner than people might have otherwise thought, in all likelihood, that's going to be the lower value non-operating-type deposits. So, in any case, we'll see. But to simplify it for a second, our base case remains modest growth in deposits for us as a company. And just pivoting away for a second from the system to us, from a share perspective, we've taken share in retail deposits, and we feel great about that. And in Wholesale, we've had some nice wins and a nice pipeline of deals there. So, that's the current thinking on that topic. So, the answer is we don't know. Okay? And you guys read economies  reports, but the fact is initially probably won't come out of deposits. Over time, it will come out of Wholesale and then maybe consumer. We're prepared for that. It doesn't actually mean that much to us in the short run. And the beta effectively, we don't expect to be that different than was in the past. There are a lot of pluses and minuses. You can argue a whole bunch of different ways, but the fact it won't be that much different, at least the first 100 basis-point increase. Just one more topic or a follow-up, I should say. Jamie, just in the shareholder letter, you had spoken about how the market is underestimating the number of Fed hikes that might be needed to curb inflation. And what's your expectation around the level of Fed tightening? I know it's difficult to make such predictions, but maybe if you could just help us understand given your own rate outlook, how that's informing how you're managing excess liquidity, given the significant capacity that you have to redeploy some of those proceeds into higher-yielding securities? Yes. So, I think the implied curve now is like 2.5% at the end of the year and maybe 3% at the end of 2023. And look, no one knows. And obviously, everyone does their forecast. I think it's going to be more than that. Okay? I give you a million different reasons why because of inflation and just about deposits. And we've never been through ever QT like this. So, this is a new thing for the world and I think is more substantially important than other people think because the huge change of flows of funds is going to create as people change their investment portfolio. So, we're going to be fine because we're going to certainly help our customers and gain share. So, what does it do for JPMorgan Chase? JPMorgan Chase, we'll be fine. We got plenty of capital, all great margins. We already have the returns we want and all things like that. So, I just -- I would just be cautious. I think what you should expect is volatile markets. Again, that's okay for us. And the Fed -- we think the Fed needs to do, they need to do to try to manage this economy and try to get to a soft landing, if possible. And any appetite to deploy the excess liquidity? No, don't expect that. The next question is coming from Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. I wonder if you could talk through the changes in the macro assumptions to capture that downside risk in CECL assumptions, just because what I want to get to is where we came from, where we're at now and then we can impose our thoughts on each quarter. Yes. I don't want to spend a lot of time on CECL. I think it's a complete waste of time. Basically, all we said is the chance of an adverse or severe adverse event is 10% higher than it was before. That's all we did, very basic. And that led to a big... It really is that... And we don't know, and it's a guess.

It's got nothing to do with the underlying business. Charge-offs are extraordinarily good, as a matter of fact, way better than they should be. I mean, middle market, 1 basis point, credit card 1.5. We would have told you in the past that the best it'll ever be is 2.5. So, credit is very good. That will get worse. NII is going to get much better. Things are going to normalize. We're still earning 16% or 17% on tangible equity. And obviously, you have -- yes. The 10% is what I wanted because your guess is better than my guess. So, I appreciate that. I don't -- Glenn, with all due respect, I do not believe it is. Okay. So, I think you might have just answered it, but I want to make sure I ask it explicitly. The follow-up I have on credit, and I know it's in much better shape, and it depends on the go forward. But are you seeing any stresses in the levered parts of the debt markets, meaning leveraged loan, high-yield, CLO, private credit, anything in there that makes you like turn a side eye? Just spread widening, a little bit less liquidity. That doesn't sound so bad. And... I mean, I think, look, we -- no one likes to be complacent about this type of stuff. And obviously, in this environment, everyone's looking very closely everywhere for any risks and trying to see around the corner. But as of right now, we're really not seeing anything of concern in the kind of spot metrics, so to speak. Maybe the last quickie on credit is just with everybody having a job and there's wage inflation and excess cash, are there any buckets of income that you're seeing early stage delinquencies picking up? In short, no. It is an interesting question as you look across our customer base, particularly in card and you sort of -- that heavily debated question of real income growth and gas prices and what's that doing to consumer balance sheets. And so, we're watching that, especially in the kind of LMI segment of our customer base. But right now, we're not actually seeing anything that gives us reason to worry. The next one is coming from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jeremy, can we follow up on your comments about building up the reserves? I think you said it was $902 million that you guys built up and was due to high inflation and the war in the Ukraine. How much was it due to inflation? And when you made that comment, is it because you're concerned about the lower-end consumer spending more money for fuel and food that might lead to greater delinquencies down the road? And how much was it due to the Ukraine situation? Yes, Glenn (sic) , it's really a lot more general than that. So just to repeat, 900 build, 300 name specific, primarily related to Russia-associated individual names. The other 600 is portfolio level. And as Jamie just said, it simply reflects increasing the probability from a very low probability to a slightly higher probability of a -- you might call it, Volcker-style, Fed-induced recession in response to the current inflationary environment, which obviously is in part driven by commodity price increases, which are in part driven by the war in Ukraine, so. But it's not a super micro portfolio level thing, except to the extent that our models handle that. It's a top-down modification of the probabilistic ways. One of the things I hated when CECL came out is that we spend a lot of time in every call yapping about CECL. I just think it's a huge mistake for all of us to spend too much time on it. Understood. And then, as a follow-up, Jeremy, if we look at the AOCI number that you gave us, and you were very clear about it's going to accrete back into the capital as those securities mature. Two things. Is there anything you can do, assuming if the long end of the curve continues to rise and probably giving you maybe a bigger hit on AOCI as we go forward, is there anything you can do to mitigate that, whether to shrink that -- the", "doc_id": "f178126b-57f6-4996-b693-d4b3801d44e6", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "c879bef06ac85ad0cfb22c8b3903547a2e17b5b51ac6e44cc48e46836ab2c82c", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 191876, "end": 195908, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96714939-cfe7-4621-b6aa-94fae9289ebf", "2": "74814759-2856-466f-9383-ce8c3d83906b", "3": "a59f9a00-52f2-4c93-ba75-668e07ac0165"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "a59f9a00-52f2-4c93-ba75-668e07ac0165": {"__data__": {"text": "forward, is there anything you can do to mitigate that, whether to shrink that -- the available-for-sale portfolio, which looks like it was $313 billion at the end of this period, or do you just have to grow the revenue, as you pointed out, as another way of growing your capital? Yes. I mean, I think that, obviously, we always try to grow revenue sort of independently of anything else. I think the large point here is, yes, there are some things that can be done to mitigate this. But the big picture is that the central case path is one that gets us to where we want to be when we need to be there in terms of CET1 and leverage. And if things don't play out as along the lines of the central case, we have tools and levers available to adjust across a range of dimensions, so. The next one is coming from Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Hi. I have a question for both, Jeremy and Jamie. Jeremy, I guess the SLR 5.2% close to the minimum, you explained that. But since quarter end, AOCI probably has gotten worse. And I'm guessing your SLR might be very even close to that minimum. So, I understand your central case, it's fine. Your outlook is good. But at what point do you say you stop buybacks, or do you think you'll buy back maybe half of the $30 billion authorization, or does JPMorgan even put on asset caps, given just the amazing asset growth over the last three months? So, that's my question for Jeremy. But the bigger picture is for you, Jamie, your CEO letter. The takeaway was in the eye of the beholder, like Jamie is really worried about a recession this year. Now he's not. So, the first question certainly ties into the second. So Jeremy, plan for buybacks, stopping at asset cap? And then, Jamie, your view of the broader economies and that feeds into your expectations for capital growth. Thank you. Okay, Mike. So, let me take this capital one. So first, let's not talk about asset caps. That's just not a meaningful thing. I think that's a distraction, and the terminology is unhelpful. Then, in terms of the leverage ratio, just remember that the denominator of that number is so big that it actually takes like pretty big moves to move the ratio. So, 5.20 is actually still pretty far away from 5%. And of course, there are relatively easy to use tools to address that as well as was alluded to earlier. In addition, I do think it's worth just reminding everyone of how the ERI restrictions work now relative to how they were at the beginning of the crisis. Just briefly, just to remember that based on the redefinition, if you drop into the regulatory buffer zone, you're subject to a 60% restriction, which based on our recent historical net income generation still gives us like ample, ample capacity to pay the dividend and so on. So, it's obviously not part of the plan, but it's just worth remembering that the cliff effects that we had in there at the beginning of the pandemic are no longer there. And then, in terms of buybacks, ['Glenn Schorr', 'Ken Usdin', 'John McDonald', 'Betsy Graseck', 'Jamie Dimon', 'Mike Mayo', 'Gerard Cassidy', 'Operator', 'Steve Chubak', 'Jeremy Barnum']\n6, CVX, 1, 2022, 2022-04-29 13:54:07, Good morning. My name is Katie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. . As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Roderick Green. Please go ahead. Thank you, Katie. Welcome to Chevron's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. I'm Roderick Green, GM of Investor Relations. Our Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth; and CFO, Pierre Breber, are on the call with me. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron's website.

Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2.  Now I'll turn it over to Mike. All right. Thanks, Roderick. Before we turn to first quarter results, I'd like to recognize the people of Ukraine. Our hearts go out to those affected by this tragedy, and we hope for a prompt and enduring diplomatic resolution.  The last 2 years have been volatile and unpredictable, driven by the global pandemic and geopolitical conflict, creating strains on economies and markets around the world. Through it all, our objectives have been clear and consistent. And in the first quarter, we continued to make progress, delivering book returns in the mid-teens, investing to grow both our traditional and New Energy businesses and returning even more cash to shareholders while maintaining an industry-leading balance sheet.  Recent events remind us of the importance of energy. Looking forward, I know that Chevron is doing its part, raising this year's Permian production outlook and advancing 2 important renewable fuel transactions: our Bunge JV, which is expected to close shortly; and the Renewable Energy Group acquisition, which is expected to close around midyear.  While the future is uncertain, our actions are not. We're on a path to delivering higher returns and lower carbon and rewarding our stakeholders all along the way.  With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre to discuss our financials. Thanks, Mike. We reported first quarter earnings of $6.3 billion or $3.22 per share. Adjusted earnings were $6.5 billion or $3.36 per share. Included in the current quarter were pension settlement costs totaling $66 million and negative foreign currency effects exceeding $200 million. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of this presentation.  Adjusted ROCE was over 15% and our net debt ratio is below 11%. A third consecutive quarter with free cash flow over $6 billion, enabled us to return $4 billion to shareholders and further pay down debt. In addition, during the quarter, we received over $4 billion in cash, with about 3,000 current and former employees exercise stock options. This quarter's proceeds from option exercises were over 4x the historical annual average of around $1 billion per year.  About 2/3 of the vest adoptions at year-end 2021 and were exercised during the first quarter, lowering the potential future rate of dilution from the outstanding balance. Over time, we expect our share buybacks to more than offset the first quarter dilutive effect.  Adjusted first quarter earnings were up $4.8 billion versus last quarter -- versus last year. Adjusted upstream earnings increased mainly on higher realizations while adjusted downstream earnings increased primarily on higher margins, partially offset by negative timing effects. Compared with last quarter, adjusted earnings were up more than $1.6 billion. Adjusted upstream earnings increased primarily on higher realizations and the absence of certain fourth quarter DD&A charges.  Liftings were lower in part due to lower production in the Gulf of Mexico. Adjusted downstream earnings decreased primarily on timing effects. The All Other segment was down primarily on unfavorable tax items and higher corporate charges. The All Other segment results can vary between quarters, and our full year guidance is unchanged.  First quarter oil equivalent production decreased 2% year-on-year due to the expiration of Rokan in Indonesia, lower production in Thailand as we approach the end of the concession and lower entitlements due to higher prices. Permian growth in the absence of Winter Storm Uri, impacts partially offset and drove U.S. oil and gas production up over 10%.  Now looking ahead. In the second quarter, we expect lower production due to planned turnarounds at Wheatstone and Angola LNG, impacts from CPC pipeline and the expiration of the Area 1 concession in Thailand. At CPC, 2 of the 3 single port moorings are now back in service and TCO has returned to full operations. Downtime associated with the April repairs is estimated to be less than 15% of our second quarter turnaround and downtime", "doc_id": "934be70a-c448-44cc-83a7-7e8fe8bae91c", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "79ce9c0f1b55b4b85b4ee65e544fb1ae649b2fc5fed1f15fa4dc741a70d68908", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 199822, "end": 204052, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96714939-cfe7-4621-b6aa-94fae9289ebf", "2": "a59f9a00-52f2-4c93-ba75-668e07ac0165", "3": "f72f9761-7ad9-4fb4-9e88-de88a5059f88"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "f72f9761-7ad9-4fb4-9e88-de88a5059f88": {"__data__": {"text": "is estimated to be less than 15% of our second quarter turnaround and downtime guidance.  We anticipate a return of capital between $250 million and $350 million from Angola LNG in the second quarter. This cash is reported through cash from investing and not cash from operations. In the first quarter, Angola LNG returned over $500 million of capital. The differences between affiliate earnings and dividends are not ratable and TCO has not yet declared a dividend in 2022. With higher commodity prices, affiliate dividends are expected to be $1 billion higher than our previous guidance.  We've utilized our NOLs and other U.S. tax attributes and expect to make estimated U.S. federal and state income tax payments in the second quarter. These payments will flow through working capital accounts, just like our first quarter IRS refunded. In the second quarter, we expect to invest $600 million as we close the Bunge joint venture and to repurchase shares at the top of our guidance range.  With that, I'll turn it back to Roderick. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take your questions. . Katie, please open the lines. . Our first question comes from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Mike, I want to start with one for you on Tengiz. There have been a number of events here in the quarter from the social unrest earlier in the quarter to the PC pipeline uncertainty and the moorings issues. So I recognize production seems to be back up and running to normal now. But I'm curious how you think about this in terms of the broader implications of what has been happening on the ground there. And it's a very important asset for Chevron. So what are your latest thoughts? Well, Phil, it's an important asset, not just to our company but to the Republic of Kazakhstan and, frankly, to world energy markets in Europe, in particular. It's a significant supplier at a time when there are concerns about supply security that you're very familiar with. So we're focused on safe and reliable operations, as you would expect, protecting people in the environment and our assets, executing the major project, that's underway. And working with all the stakeholders that are involved in this. So that includes partners, it includes, obviously, the government of Kazakhstan and our customers.  So the risks that I think you're referring to are risks that are present in Kazakhstan and in varying degrees, in other parts of the world as well. And that's part of what we do is manage those risks on the ground each and every day. There are times when the environment feels a bit more benign, but you can't take your eyes off those risks because they can materialize at any point.  So to this point in time, we've been able to make good progress on the project. Some impact really from the weather-related downtime at the loading buoys at lower . But 2 of those are back in service and the third one is slated for repair, which would give us plenty of redundant capacity there. So we continue to stay very focused on every aspect of managing that our people on the ground are empowered to do what it takes and to be very responsive in real time. And I'm incredibly proud of the work that they've done in a very challenging environment. Understood. I appreciate your thoughts. My second question would be for Pierre on cash flows or cash balances. The quarter did come in a bit lower than expected on cash flows, and I think you highlighted some timing factors. But you did get a bunch of cash from the stock vesting. So cash balances are up quite significantly. So I was wondering, I don't know if there's anything else to highlight on the moving pieces of the cash flow. But even at strip prices with your buybacks, it seems like cash balances will keep going up. So just what are your latest thoughts on managing the cash from here? Thanks, Phil. First, let me just talk about cash in the quarter. Cash in the quarter was very strong. As I pointed out, our dividends from affiliates are not ratable. And particularly from TCO, which historically has paid dividends in the fourth quarter, we increased our guidance on expected dividends, but they were light in the", "doc_id": "f72f9761-7ad9-4fb4-9e88-de88a5059f88", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "86abeba3327be89bdd184e85a592bceadad98396059dcea01111adfd686bb1f4", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 204067, "end": 208232, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96714939-cfe7-4621-b6aa-94fae9289ebf", "2": "934be70a-c448-44cc-83a7-7e8fe8bae91c", "3": "db511917-a228-4387-bd25-b8d239f050c9"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "db511917-a228-4387-bd25-b8d239f050c9": {"__data__": {"text": "we increased our guidance on expected dividends, but they were light in the first quarter. So yes, that's timing. I also pointed out that Angola LNG returned $500 million of capital. That's essentially operating cash. That's a function of operating an LNG facility and selling it into the European gas markets at TTF prices.  However, adjusted to the accounting rules, it's flowing through cash from investing and not cash from ops. But for all intents and purposes, it is operating cash flow. And at some point in time in the future, it might revert back to that depending on the retained earnings in that affiliate. Another item I did not mention is that it's a typical item that happens in the first quarter. We pay out our long-term incentive compensation, which a portion of that is in the form of restricted stock and performance shares.  That is, again, happens annually, but with a higher stock price, that was a higher payment than in previous years. That does not flow through working capital. That comes out of a long-term liability account. And then as I mentioned, we expect to make estimated tax payments next quarter, but that will flow through working capital in many of analysts look at our cash flow ex working capital. But our IRS refund also went through working capital that we had guided to in the first quarter.  In terms of our cash balances, we're running a little bit high on our cash balance. That's why we refer to net debt, but we have a couple of cash items coming up. We expect to close REG around midyear. That's $3 billion. And we have an offering up right now to do a make whole call on about $3 billion of bonds. These are bonds that are economic to call back. And then on the buybacks, I mean, we just increased our buyback guidance at our Investor Day back in March to $5 billion to $10 billion W.e were at $5 billion rate here in the first quarter. We're doubling it now to the top of the range of $10 billion, and we'll just see where the environment goes from here.  We are not setting -- we are setting the buyback at a rate that we can maintain across the commodity cycle. We could have a higher buyback rate this quarter or next quarter, but the goal is not to maximize the buyback rate in any individual quarter. It's to set it at a level that we can maintain when the cycle turns. And therefore, we can rebalance our net debt ratio closer to our mid-cycle guidance. We'll take our next question from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley. So the first one I wanted to ask is just on the Permian results and guidance increase. I was wondering if you could talk through in a bit more detail some of the drivers there. Are you adding activity? Is it better performance on the activity you had already budgeted for? Is it nonoperated? Just walk through some of the drivers there and how you're thinking about that. Yes, Devin, we did have a strong first quarter and a couple of big things to bear in mind there. As we slowed things down in 2020 when demand contracted due to the pandemic, what happened is we ended up with an inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells that grew beyond what would be kind of a normal run rate for our rig fleet. And so we've been working through that and we're back down now to what you could think of as a more normal factory model. We always want to have docks out in front of the completion crews but that had grown to a larger than normal rate.  So as we've caught that up, that's pretty efficient. It's the first place you turn as you see the cycle turn is completing those wells to get that production online, and we'll be moving into more of a factory model. So it will level out a little bit versus what might feel like a little bit of a surge. We also get some nonratable joint venture bookings that show up. And so both of those contributed to a very strong first quarter.  And of course, by the time you look at how that would roll through in the continued activity for the rest of this year, it's pretty clear that we'll end up higher than the initial guidance that we had put out. So -- but we haven't stepped up our program. We haven't stepped up a number of rigs. We haven't stepped up", "doc_id": "db511917-a228-4387-bd25-b8d239f050c9", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "db5e9b6f165d7e02f39e04ad758c659877ed1c9b7232aa5f9d47c8e71dfcd414", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 208235, "end": 212407, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96714939-cfe7-4621-b6aa-94fae9289ebf", "2": "f72f9761-7ad9-4fb4-9e88-de88a5059f88", "3": "13f31969-ab4c-4c89-9677-9d8cdf48d32e"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "13f31969-ab4c-4c89-9677-9d8cdf48d32e": {"__data__": {"text": "program. We haven't stepped up a number of rigs. We haven't stepped up spending. It's all really a function of getting the machine running again. And then underneath that, there's ongoing efficiency improvements that we continue to see. Got it. That's very helpful. And my second question is on your global gas and LNG portfolio. And I was wondering if you could just give us an update on how you're looking at some of the medium and longer-term opportunities there given what's going on in markets. And specifically, I'm thinking about Eastern Med and that gas position. And then also whether or not integration into some type of LNG facility in the U.S. might make sense for some of your production growth there as well? Sure. So LNG is on everybody's mind these days. It's important to meeting Europe's needs. It's important to delivering a lower carbon energy system globally, and we see this strong market here in the near term. Eastern Med is a wonderful asset. I was just over there 2 weeks ago. I visited the Leviathan platform, we spent a lot of time with our people in the business there. And they've recently completed a project to increase infrastructure access to regional markets and we're actually flowing more gas into Egypt as a result of that.  We're looking at a number of other opportunities to further increased production because the resource there is quite prolific. And that includes further coal-to-gas switching in Israel for the regional supply into neighboring countries, potential power generation for power distribution through the region, floating LNG, potentially using oilage and other LNG facilities in the region, a number of different commercial options that are being evaluated and worked.  So more to come as those mature, but it's an area of high priority for us because the market demand for it. When you look at the U.S., clearly, we've got a lot of gas production here that largely prices at Henry Hub today. And there are these projects that are in the process for LNG export facilities. We've had discussions with a number of those developers, nothing to say more than we've had discussions at this point.  But that's part of our LNG portfolio that we've been very focused on the Pacific Basin historically. And as the Atlantic Basin markets now look a little bit different as we flow gas from our West African assets into the Atlantic Basin, it may make sense for us to have some U.S. supply as well. So we'll advise you as we advance anything there. We'll take our next question from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Mike, I just love your perspective on the oil macro. You always have a good read on it. It strikes us that inventories for product and oil are very tight right now. You've got jet fuel recovering over the summer. We'll see what happens in China. Shale has an inelastic supply response. So how does this ultimately resolve itself in the near term? Do you ultimately need to solve or demand destruction through crack or flat price of oil? Or is there something that we're missing? No, Neil. I mean you're putting your finger on all the levers. If you step back from it, supply always responds more slowly than demands does. And in normal times, which we have not been in for the last couple of years, both of them kind of gradually move in relative sympathy with one another. You've got storage out there that can buffer any near-term imbalances. I'm repeating what you all know. But in 2020, we saw a contraction unlike anything I've seen in my lifetime. And we had to really constrain activity. There was no sense producing more oil when the world needed a lot less.  And it wasn't clear at the time how long that might last and how deep it would be. And so the entire industry, every segment of the industry responded to that. And then as we've come out of the pandemic, demand growth has surged. And as you say, we haven't seen it all come back yet. Air travel, while it's -- domestic air travel in the U.S. is pretty strong, international air travel still has a ways to go to recover to pre-pandemic levels.  And then China and other parts of the world are still in various stages of lockdown at various points in time. And so we haven't seen a full", "doc_id": "13f31969-ab4c-4c89-9677-9d8cdf48d32e", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "c0ebcf95e3bd046149042a98490384be68717b0de17485647c2175c362bd562b", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 212413, "end": 216626, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96714939-cfe7-4621-b6aa-94fae9289ebf", "2": "db511917-a228-4387-bd25-b8d239f050c9", "3": "629c26a9-58d3-4ab8-ba34-a2a736a979aa"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "629c26a9-58d3-4ab8-ba34-a2a736a979aa": {"__data__": {"text": "stages of lockdown at various points in time. And so we haven't seen a full recovery of demand there. So even with that, demand has now responded more quickly than supply can match it. And then you overlay a host of other issues, right? The independent E&Ps feeling more of an obligation to return cash to their shareholders. Some of the big integrated companies have reprioritized new energy versus traditional energy and have indicated they intend to shrink rather than grow their oil and gas production.  And then the NOCs going around the world, everybody has got a little bit of a different situation. So it's a market that is not stable. It's not an equilibrium. Right now, as you say, inventories are quite low. Demand is still strong, and economies to this point seem to be handling it. At some point, particularly if prices were to move higher, I do think it starts to be a bigger drag on the economy than what we've seen to this point.  But there's a lot of attention in this market and the supply response is coming. We're up 10% in the U.S. year-on-year. We're working on the big project in Kazakhstan, which will start up over the next couple of years. And others around the world have got things that they're doing as well. But it just comes in at a different pace than the demand has moved. And I think we're in a market that's tight right now, that has a lot of uncertainty and I think that is not likely to resolve itself in the near term, the uncertainty. Things like the SPR release in the near term can do a certain amount to call those markets. But over time, it's a cyclical business. There's a lot of resource out there that can be produced at prices lower than we see today.  And one of the lessons is history is just as the bad times don't last forever, neither do the times when prices are strong, and so we can't start to believe they'll always be like this. But I think in the relative short term here, the tensions that you referred to are likely to remain. It's a great perspective, Mike. Another big picture question is, if you think about 20 years ago at the beginning of the last super cycle, you had very similar, very large multiple arbitrages between the super majors and even large independents and some of the majors. And one could look at your multiple on consensus and say you trade a premium relative to a lot of the global majors. Do you think there's value in mega M&A in the space? And do you see yourself as a logical consolidator, given that M&A is such a core competency and it worked out incredibly well for you 20 years ago with Texaco? Yes. We're always looking at these things, Neil. I think history would suggest that deals done in an upcycle or near the top of the cycle don't necessarily look as well in hindsight as deals that were done in a different part of the cycle. 20 years ago, when there was a number of transactions that you referred to, we were coming out of oil prices in the teens or the '20s. And so consolidation made sense.  There were a lot of synergies to be harvested as you put some of these companies together. I think the entire industry is more efficient today than it was then certainly large companies, which you refer to kind of large-scale M&A. And so I think the synergy opportunities, while no doubt there would be some, they may not be of the same magnitude that they were 20 years ago. We've all used technology and other things to improve the efficiency of our operations.  So I never say never, but I don't know that just because we're trading at a relatively strong multiple right now that, that should lead you to believe that it means we're more likely to do something that our track record of discipline would suggest. We'll take our next question from Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Our first question, maybe we just hit back on cash returns. The buyback for 2Q annualized again, is at the top of your range. And Pierre, I think you reiterated on Phil's question that buybacks are intended to be through the cycle. Can you just maybe provide a little bit of commentary on how you're viewing the buyback in relation to mid-cycle cash flow? Thanks, Jeanine.

So we're very in tune with what our mid-cycle cash flow capabilities are. We showed at our Investor Day low case of $50 Brent and show that we can maintain the buyback for multiple years, even though $50 is notionally right around the breakeven for covering both our dividend and our capital. And then, of course, we showed the high case of $75 where buybacks were, in fact, higher than the current $10 billion guidance.  And we could buy back at that point in time, it was more than 25% of the company, it's a little bit less based on the current stock price. So that's exactly how we're thinking about it. To Neil's question and the macro, it was just 2 years ago today on this earnings call, that Chevron was the only company to show a 2-year stress test at $30 Brent. And that was a real stress test. And we showed that we could maintain the dividend, invest in the business for long-term value. We certainly reduced some short-cycle capital.  And yes, we would take on some debt, but we'd have a debt ratio that would still be very manageable. And in fact, would be not far from where many of our competitors were entering the COVID crisis. So as Mike says, we're mindful of the cycles that are in our business, we have to plan and manage for them. Again, we could have -- we can afford a much bigger buyback program next quarter. We don't -- you know, Jeanine, that a net debt ratio under 11% is not what we're targeting. I mean that's just how the math works.  We grew our dividend 6% earlier this year. Our dividend is up nearly 20% since COVID, while many in the industry cut their dividends during the last couple of years. Our investment -- organic investment is up more than 30% versus last year. When you include our announced acquisitions, total investment is up 50%. So clearly, we're investing, as Mike has said, to grow both our traditional new energy businesses.  And we paid down debt, and we've been increasing our buyback as we've seen the strength of this upcycle and the likely duration of it increase, but the cycle will turn and we'll continue to do buybacks. And so we want to set the buyback at a rate that we can manage it, not only at our mid-cycle cash flow generation capability, but even when it goes below that. Again, we're going to -- there's going to be a time where we're going to be buying back shares, and we'll be doing it on the balance sheet because we want to relever back closer to that 20% to 25% net debt ratio range that I've talked about. Okay. Great. Very helpful. Maybe if we just can move back to the assets on the Permian. Permian for you guys is firing on all cylinders, clearly have a big asset there with huge long-term value. One of the things that has been talked about a bunch recently is just FT on the gas side and how you kind of see that evolving. Just wondering how Chevron is looking at that for your long-term plans. Yes, Jeanine, we -- I'm glad you talked about long-term plans because we've had a long-term Permian plan. And interestingly, notwithstanding one of the most volatile 2-year periods we've seen, our production profile doesn't look that different than it did just a couple of years ago in terms of where we're headed. And of course, that drives everything from contracting for rigs and completion services to takeaway capacity for oil and gas liquids and gas. We've got sufficient takeaway capacity for our production through the middle of this decade.  And as we look forward, we're working on what it takes beyond that period of time. So we don't flare in the Permian. And so we've got to be sure we've got gas takeaway or we're not going to produce oil. And so it's a high priority for our midstream team. But we don't see pinch points", "doc_id": "dc0dda40-c9b3-475c-b48f-a8e80f28e02c", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "baf2abc92596eae858fc6dc90204f59cf67102899656fcf8642ecd2f66303d5c", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 220768, "end": 224730, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96714939-cfe7-4621-b6aa-94fae9289ebf", "2": "629c26a9-58d3-4ab8-ba34-a2a736a979aa", "3": "d2acbf6c-c95e-475c-9a81-faf3aff3b9c2"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "d2acbf6c-c95e-475c-9a81-faf3aff3b9c2": {"__data__": {"text": "so it's a high priority for our midstream team. But we don't see pinch points anytime soon, and we continue to be a very attractive shipper for the people that we do business with because we're predictable. We've got a strong track record of continuing to deliver the growth that we have indicated. We got a strong balance sheet and all those things mean that people like to do business with us. So we feel pretty good about that for the next few years. We'll take our question from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Two questions, please. First on inflation. Pierre, just curious, I mean for your CapEx for the next, say, 2 or 3 years, do you have a percentage you can share? What percent of your CapEx is in pretty much fixed price contracts, so don't subject much to inflation and what percent is really quite vulnerable to inflation? And also when we're looking at your CapEx for this year, the Bunge JV $600 million investment, is that included in your original budget or that this will be in addition to your original budget? That's the first question.  The second question maybe is for Mike, that with the much sharply higher commodity prices, when you have discussion and negotiation with the NOC, the host government, is there a change in the attitude on that it become more difficult for you to get better terms? Or that this is happening too quick and so you haven't really seen any change in the way how you conduct the discussion with your counterpart in the national companies or the host government? I'll start... Pierre, do you want to start on -- yes, go ahead. Yes, I'll start on the first question. There are several parts to it. So first, the Bunge joint venture, anything that is an acquisition inorganic is not included in our $15.3 billion budget that we shared back in December. So I think we cited that, in fact, in that press release that Bunge would be in addition. And then the other potential inorganic, there was a little bit of inorganic in the first quarter that included an investment in Carbon Clean, a technology company. REG also will not be included.  You won't see REG though, even in our total capital, our total C&E because it's a company acquisition. Let me just talk about cost inflation a little bit. We are seeing more cost pressure in the Permian. It's manageable. But if we go outside the U.S. seeing hardly any or much more modest increases, and none of that is changing our $15.3 billion CapEx budget that we've talked about. I'll remind everyone that the Permian is 20% of our capital budget. So it gets a lot of attention.  But again, 80% of it is not -- or outside the U.S. is not seeing much cost pressure at all. In the Permian, as Mike said, we plan our business. So we have all the equipment and services to execute our plan. And we've seen a little bit more than we had budgeted, but we can offset some of that with efficiencies in the Permian and with reductions elsewhere in the portfolio. Our focus is turning to 2023 and securing all the equipment and services that we'll need to execute that plan. But we'll share the details as we update our annual budget, which we do every December.  In general, Paul, you can think that we contract 30% to 40% of our total supplies each year. So that every 2 to 3 years on a rotational basis, it can vary, it depends by location. But we don't -- notionally, we are going to be exposed to some of these higher prices as we move into future years. Again, we've been able to manage this year very well depending on -- due to how we contracted previously.  Our $15 billion to $17 billion capital guidance, which goes on for 5 years, kind of assumes mid-cycle conditions. So it has the ability to absorb some of these cost increases that are transient. And so we'll execute within that. We have Tengiz coming off, which will open up more room in that capital guidance. And again, we'll share all the details when we release our capital budget in December.  But the bottom line is we're seeing modest increase. As we said, overall, our capital budget had just a few low single digits of COGS inflation for this year, a little bit more than that in the Permian.", "doc_id": "d2acbf6c-c95e-475c-9a81-faf3aff3b9c2", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "1733ee587cd91d92f9e99da41c66e475a2f734183a0e00b4b89ce7b2b4cf3e36", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 224733, "end": 228879, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96714939-cfe7-4621-b6aa-94fae9289ebf", "2": "dc0dda40-c9b3-475c-b48f-a8e80f28e02c", "3": "feadfc80-bb53-4fcf-8667-116c999a9ccd"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "feadfc80-bb53-4fcf-8667-116c999a9ccd": {"__data__": {"text": "inflation for this year, a little bit more than that in the Permian. It's all very manageable, and we're working hard to secure contracts for future years activity. Mike? Okay. Paul, your second question was on discussions with host governments on concessions and how that may be affected by the price environment. I would tell you that right now, we're pretty early into this price upcycle. And I'm not sure that I can say we've seen a lot of change as people are really adjusting to the environment we're in. But on the broader issue of concession extensions, look, we've got to find these opportunities and negotiations that create value for the company and for the host country. And so you really have to look at it through the lens of both.  We had long histories in both Indonesia and Thailand. I would have liked to extend those concessions that are rolling off last year and this year, but we couldn't find an outcome that satisfied the host governments expectations and that would compete for capital within our portfolio, which has got a lot of alternatives. The flip side of that is Angola, where we last year extended our Block 0 concession from 2030 out to 2050.  And that's a partnership that started more than 60 years ago. And there was a lot of common ground there on contributing to reliable and cleaner supply for Angola, reducing greenhouse gas emissions there and finding a way to do that on terms that will attract capital within our portfolio.  So we approach each one of these things, looking for value for our shareholders and to provide a proposition for other stakeholders that they find acceptable. Sometimes we can achieve that. Other times, we can't. So more to follow probably in terms of -- if this turns out to be a long upcycle, how that may change those dynamics. But I think the fundamental approach that we take is unlikely to change. We'll take our next question from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Yes. If we could maybe talk a little bit about some of the bigger projects, thinking about your answer earlier, Mike, on some of the macro items and under investment. I know you have some things in the Gulf of Mexico. You've obviously got an extensive LNG footprint globally. How do you think over the next couple of years blending in your kind of known deepwater projects and then the possibility of doing something again on the LNG front? Yes. So we've got a nice set of projects under development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Jack/St. Malo has a multiphase pumping project that will start up this year. Next year, we'll hit the first waterflood injection on St. Malo and some additional development drilling there. Big Foot, which is on production right now. We've got ongoing development drilling and water injection soon to follow. Mad Dog 2 is slated for first oil this year.  We've got Anchor, which is expected to have first oil in 2024. Whale also expecting to have first oil in 2024. We just sanctioned Ballymore, which we'll have first oil in 2025. So there are -- there's a queue of these things that is rolling through.

In addition, this call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives, which should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's periodic SEC reports. Following prepared remarks this morning, we'll turn the call over for questions. Please limit yourself to one question. If you have more than one, please ask your most pressing one first and then reenter the queue. Now I'll turn the call over to James. Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. First and foremost, on behalf of our company and our entire system, I'd like to share our deepest sympathies to all those who have been affected by what's happening in Ukraine. The safety of our people and their families continues to be our top priority. And as we highlighted in our release this morning, we are taking actions to provide that support. Now this morning, I'll discuss how we drove strong results in the quarter and that we are reiterating our guidance even in the face of incremental challenges. Then John will discuss the financial details of the quarter and how our work has prepared us for whatever may be around the corner. We all know that much has happened in the world since we last talked with you in February, leading, for sure, to an operating environment that is fast changing and increasingly complex. However, we remain confident about the future and are well equipped to manage external factors worldwide through our strengthened leadership position with the right portfolio, the right strategy and the right execution in the marketplace. After a promising start to the year, the operating environment soon changed with very significant geopolitical conflict, a resurgence of COVID in various places, record-high inflation and continued challenges on the supply chain front. Nonetheless, we've consistently sustained our momentum from last year, moving with agility as conditions changed to generate strong top and bottom line growth in the quarter. We delivered 8% unit case volume growth, primarily driven by strong recovery in away-from-home channels and continued growth in our home channels. Volume growth was strong across all operating segments, driven by marketing investments and aided by an increase in consumer mobility as the impact of the pandemic abated in most regions. Our enhanced capabilities helped us gain value share overall in both at-home and away-from-home channels globally and across most of our geographic operating segments, a clear indicator of the power of our new approach. Amidst the dynamic macro conditions and an inflationary cost backdrop, we focused on delivering growth. The key competitive edge of The Coca-Cola system continues to be the ability to deliver value for our consumers and our customers in any environment. Our accelerated agenda in marketing and innovation is tying our beverages to daily consumption occasions, adding and creating value for our brands. Additionally, we continue to work with our bottling partners to expand package offerings and strengthen distribution to capture growth opportunities, using all the available revenue growth management levers, including price, to win in the marketplace. These scaled global initiatives are coming to life at a local level all around the world. So let's start with Asia Pacific. In India, we drove excellence in integrated execution as consumer mobility improved across channels by stepping up product availability, adding approximately 240,000 outlets and over 50,000 coolers. We also continue to build relevance through innovation by launching Maaza Aam Panna to leverage our equity in Mango and Fanta Apple to expand our footprint in the fast-growing fruit-flavored sparkling subcategory.

Japan is emerging from its extended state of emergency, and we've increased our consumer base and driven market share gains in key categories. The Coke ON app reached 35 million app downloads, continuing the direct engagement with consumers to create and capture value. We also continued our focus on ESG initiatives with 100% recycled PET bottles now available in Japan for 5 key brands, including Coke and Georgia Coffee. In China, a strong start in January, led by an excellent Chinese New Year brand activation with Coke, was followed by strict COVID lockdowns, and this resulted in reduced consumer mobility. Momentum reversed in February and March and led to a decline in unit case volume during the quarter. We're moving fast to focus on core SKUs and ensure product availability. We're adapting how we engage with consumers depending upon local market conditions, and we're working in close collaboration with our bottling partners to focus on execution basics like increasing multipack availability and maximizing share of visible inventory in channels and regions that are open. In ASEAN and South Pacific, we gained share in key countries and across most categories, while consumer mobility was mixed and supply chain headwinds remained. Growth was led by Trademark Coke and sparkling flavors, driven by strong end-to-end execution of the , Sprite Heat Happens and the Fanta Colorful People brand campaigns. In EMEA, notwithstanding the conflict in Ukraine and an uptick in inflation, we delivered a strong performance in Europe in the quarter. The continued rollout of new and improved Coca-Cola Zero Sugar across key markets helped drive 5 percentage points of sparkling single-serve mix growth, which is ahead of pre-pandemic levels. Topo Chico Hard Seltzer is closing the gap with the #1 hard seltzer brand in Europe, and the eB2B business with myccep.com accounted for low double-digit contribution to total revenue. We are keeping a close watch on the spillover reflex of the conflict in Ukraine on the health of the consumer, and we remain ready to pivot and adapt. In Africa, macroeconomic recovery is underway, although conditions remain challenging due to inflationary pressure. In South Africa, we accelerated refillable PET expansion and the execution of in-store sampling to retain consumers. We are connecting with our existing customers in the digital space and have surpassed 65,000 outlets on the Wabi eB2B platform, significantly ahead of plan. Despite macro volatility and intense inflation in the region, Eurasia and Middle East drove top line growth through a strong suite of marketing programs across categories, led by sparkling and ready-to-drink tea. In Turkey, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar became the #2 immediate consumption player in value share behind brand Coke. In Pakistan, Coke Studio, a platform that unites diverse cultures through the power of music, drove social engagement that reached an all-time high in terms of impressions and viewings. In North America, we are seeing more inflation and continue to navigate supply chain dynamics. We're closely monitoring further pressure in some inputs such as high fructose corn syrup, PET and metals, along with wages and transportation as they impact us as well as our bottling partners. Despite these challenges, we continue to gain share in both at-home and away-from-home channels and across most categories. The strong rollout of Real Magic platform and the successful launch of Coke Starlight resulted in Coke Trademark being the fastest-growing trademark in measured retail, driving household penetration up a full point. Powerade posed its power launch during NCAA March Madness, generating more than 1 billion impressions. We also continue to learn from the returnable glass-bottled pilot that has been implemented in the Southwest. In Latin America, we delivered strong performance despite challenging macro conditions, and the investments we made to sustain momentum are paying off. We remain focused on integrated execution and drove revenue growth faster than transaction growth, both of which grew faster than unit case volume growth.

The Prospera loyalty program added nearly 50,000 retailers in the quarter while continuing to advance our customer-focused digital expansion. Notably, we have digitized nearly 2 million customers in the region, and we are leveraging the strong system alignment with our bottling partners and are continuing to execute for growth. Within Global Ventures, despite an inflationary backdrop in the UK, Costa continued to recover driven by retail and strong like-for-like sales with Costa Express. In China, while retail sales were impacted by store closures due to the pandemic, Costa ready-to-drink coffee sustained its #2 position and continue to innovate with Costa chart. Finally, our Bottling Investments Group delivered strong Q1 performance, driven by the expansion of affordable immediate consumption entry packs in key markets, and this resulted in share gains in sparkling. We also continue to make progress towards optimizing trade promotions and cost to serve in our key markets and raise the bar on operational excellence. Clearly, the operating environment has proven to be more challenging, but we're pleased with the results we delivered in the first quarter. We continue to believe the recovery in 2022 will be asynchronous. We anticipate many new chapters and challenges, including, but not limited to, ongoing geopolitical conflict; uncertain consumer sentiment amidst the increasingly inflationary environment, accelerated cost pressures and ongoing supply challenges; and of course, continued evolution of pandemic. That said, the changes we have made during the pandemic have left us better positioned than ever to capture growth, increasing our confidence in the future. The multiple levers of revenue growth management have never been more important, and our investments in building this capability over the past few years are giving us a clear advantage. Further actions on pricing will depend on the consumer and inflationary environment as the year progresses, but we will continue to rely on a mix of price, package differentiation and ever-sharper promotional strategies. Through integrated RGM and execution capabilities, we adapt to local market conditions and give consumers what they want, where they want it and at the right price. By extending package offerings to keep transaction driving price points in play, we retain consumers through affordability while also driving premiumization with innovation and targeted pricing. For example, in Latin America, we are continuing the expansion of refillables to sparkling flavors and juices, and this remains a compelling consumer proposition to address the need for affordability. In North America, we're maximizing value by initiatives like the one expanding the availability of mini cans for consumption across occasions such as breaks and meals and by offering 6 packs, 10 packs and 30 packs, driving an approximate 45% increase in retail dollars in measured channels and their near-20% increase in total distribution points. Our networked organization structure extends to our system. Our bottling partners complement our progress against our capabilities by continuing to invest in the marketplace, and they help put our purpose into action. We have strong partners with highly capable and experienced leadership, and we continue to build and foster our business and each in our relationship that drive system health and long-term growth opportunities. With our purpose to refresh the world to make a difference, we continue to focus our ESG work on issues where we can have a measurable positive impact on communities as well as create opportunities for our business to grow. We release our fourth combined business and ESG report tomorrow, an integrated approach to reporting that is a strong demonstration of how sustainability is linked to our business, builds resilience and demonstrates transparency. We have a long history of assuring select sustainability metrics while also providing key public disclosures against the TCFD recommendations as well as other reporting frameworks such as SASB, GRI and the UN Global Compact.

Now I'll turn the call over to John. Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll highlight our first quarter performance and discuss our full year 2022 earnings guidance; then I'll provide commentary on the overall operating environment and how our organization is navigating effectively to drive results. Let me first start by saying how pleased we are with the results in the first quarter. We delivered strong organic revenue growth of 18%; unit cases grew 8%, with strong growth across all operating segments; concentrate sales were ahead of unit cases by 3 points in the quarter, primarily due to the timing of shipments in Latin America and EMEA. Our price/mix of 7% was driven by strategic pricing, revenue growth management initiatives, further improvement in away-from-home channels in most markets and positive segment mix. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was down approximately 90 basis points versus the prior year, primarily due to the impact of 2 items: one, consolidating the BODYARMOR; and two, currency headwinds. Underlying gross margin expanded despite continued pressure from commodity costs, due to pricing actions in the market and a benefit from the timing of concentrate shipments. We continue to prioritize consumer-facing marketing to maximize returns while driving productivity in our operating costs leading to leverage in the P&L. Comparable operating margin expanded by approximately 50 basis points despite acquisition and currency headwinds. First quarter comparable EPS of $0.64 grew 16% year-over-year. This was driven by strong top line growth which benefited from the timing of concentrate shipments and operating margin improvements, partially offset by currency and cost headwinds. On the cash flow front, we delivered free cash flow of approximately $400 million in the first quarter as our strong business performance was more than offset primarily by 2 items: one, cycling the timing of working capital benefits in the prior year; and two, higher 2021 annual incentives paid in the first quarter. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our cash flow goals for the full year. Our balance sheet continues to be strong, with net debt leverage within our targeted range of 2x to 2.5x. As James mentioned, much has happened since we last gave guidance in February. The conflict in Ukraine has created further volatility in the world as well as added to the inflationary backdrop and impacted the currency market. The resurgence of COVID in China and some other geographies around the world is a clear indication that the pandemic is still very much a part of the conversation, and a reminder that the recovery path has been and will continue to be asynchronous. Obviously, there are lots of puts and takes at play, and we see a number of potential futures coming at us. But notwithstanding this backdrop, we believe our organization is better prepared today, and we're confident in the flexibility we've built and our ability to manage what's around the corner. We continue to spin the growth flywheels faster, and our local businesses are adapting and executing for growth. With that in mind, this morning, we are reiterating our guidance for 2022. We continue to expect organic revenue growth of approximately 7% to 8% and comparable currency-neutral earnings per share guidance of 8% to 10% growth versus 2021. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we are reiterating our currency outlook of a 2- to 3-point currency headwinds to comparable net revenues and a 3- to 4-point currency headwinds to comparable earnings per share for full year 2022. Additionally, taking into account our current understanding of recently issued regulations, we now expect an effective tax rate of 19.5% in 2022 versus the 20% that we had guided to previously. All in, we continue to expect comparable earnings per share growth of 5% to", "doc_id": "302c6610-1377-48cf-bb6e-f441ee17d82e", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "2e021ab99640886a4e1bc51815642a556b5c024f7338028d121823516f280257", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 246180, "end": 250486, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96714939-cfe7-4621-b6aa-94fae9289ebf", "2": "b98c2e7f-4b9b-4a29-ba56-2ea21352d5a7", "3": "4bcd46d8-77f8-47ba-bc4f-ac790f73d8d5"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "4bcd46d8-77f8-47ba-bc4f-ac790f73d8d5": {"__data__": {"text": "All in, we continue to expect comparable earnings per share growth of 5% to 6% versus 2021. And we continue to expect to generate approximately $10.5 billion of free cash flow for 2022 through approximately $12 billion in cash from operations, less approximately $1.5 billion in capital investments. To put this guidance in context, there are some considerations to keep in mind for 2022. The direct impact of the Ukraine conflict and the resulting suspension of business in Russia is estimated to be approximately $0.04 to comparable EPS. The recent increases in commodity costs are having an incremental effect. But based on current rates and hedge positions, we expect the commodity price inflation to remain in the range of mid-single digit impact on comparable cost of goods sold in 2022. Additionally, we see incremental cost pressure coming from areas like wages and transportation. The consolidation of the BODYARMOR finished goods business will continue to have a mechanical effect on margins. When it comes to capital allocation, our priorities remain the same, and we continue to balance financial flexibility with efficient capital structure. For 2022, we announced a dividend increase of 5%, a higher rate than in recent years; and we also announced the resumption of share repurchases with approximately $500 million in net share repurchases expected this year. Despite uncertainties around the world, our strategic transformation has fortified the organization to weather the storm, and we are extremely proud of how our people are responding and delivering. We are keeping consumers at the center, operating more effectively and efficiently and unlocking the immense potential of our growth portfolio of brands. This gives us confidence that we can deliver on our guidance for 2022. And with that, operator, we are ready to take questions. . Our first question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. I was hoping we could talk a little bit more about Latin America, an area like you called out about performance, in particular, Mexico and Brazil this quarter. And I had sort of 2 sets of questions. One is this is a region where your partnership with bottling has been particularly strong certainly versus the past. And if you could talk a little bit about how that may be enabling your ability to be performing as well as you are in this challenging time. So that's kind of one. And then two was there was a mention in the release about shares being down. It looked -- I'm guessing it might be in juice because I think you talked about sparkling being up, but anything in particular you're doing or the degree to which the market share performance is an area, a watch point for you and how you're balancing that versus thinking about recovering cost inflation. Yes. There was -- I think we'll call that several questions. I never do it, though. So I'm sorry. It's the first time. Okay. We'll be -- in the spirit of generosity, we'll try and -- because they're very related. Look, we have a great partnership with our bottlers in Latin America from the 2 very big ones. Coke FEMSA, Arca Continental, through Andina and some of the more country-based bottlers. And we have developed collectively the system, many capabilities on many fronts, whether it be marketing automation, but particularly, the levers of revenue growth management and execution in volatile times. It escapes no one's attention that Latin America was a place that has had a rollercoaster of economic growth and inflation and difficulties. And we have a very deep partnership with these bottlers to work through these times. And that, I think, you see reflected in this quarter as we had a lot of good growth. The share did come in negative overall. I think there's a couple of things going on there. As you say, we did a lot better in sparkling, a lot of good execution in sparkling. And there was some pressure as much in juice or some of the juice drink categories, but also category mix. We are very much focused on, as we've talked about previously that when you are in a cost environment, that those cost increases, whether it be commodities or wages or logistics or marketing costs, need to go through over time. We have to earn the right for the brands to take if they need to go through. Sometimes when you're in a very high share market like Latin America and you", "doc_id": "4bcd46d8-77f8-47ba-bc4f-ac790f73d8d5", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "fa25cf3ee51e773454cce6f6763d9a6929cb4aa993ed07b352f3fc4d419ce8b6", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 250497, "end": 254859, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96714939-cfe7-4621-b6aa-94fae9289ebf", "2": "302c6610-1377-48cf-bb6e-f441ee17d82e", "3": "de2994f4-2dbd-42a1-808d-90e68ef12233"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "de2994f4-2dbd-42a1-808d-90e68ef12233": {"__data__": {"text": "need to go through. Sometimes when you're in a very high share market like Latin America and you lead on pricing, not all competitors necessarily follow immediately, and that can have temporary impacts on share. But we, with the bottlers, will be very focused on not only continuing to carry on growing, but to regain and expand our share position. Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. So I just want to focus on top line visibility here. You obviously kept the full year top line guidance despite the Russia impact. So underlying sales are moving OpEx. Russia, in Q1, was another strong quarter. But clearly, there's risk consumer spending might weaken with the unprecedented inflation we're seeing. So first, maybe just looking backwards, can you give us an update on if you're seeing any signs of consumer stress in terms of impact on your business or pushback to higher pricing around the world, either late in Q1 or in April? And then also on a go-forward basis, can you juxtapose the positive impact of normalization of COVID behavior on your business as away-from-home recovers maybe versus any potential macro pressure you could see our consumer spending weakness? And how that impacts your visibility in terms of full year top line view? Well, clearly, my active generosity, and Lauren has unleashed a torrent of multi-question questions, but it would be harsh to cut it off at this stage, Dara. Look, a couple of things. We did come in with strong momentum out of 2021 and coming to this year. And as I and John and we talked about previously on calls, we believe that pricing for our business has to be earned for the brands. We have to give the consumer and the retailer reason for the price increase and for the value of our brands, whether it's the marketing, the innovation, the execution or the packaging options, we do that. It's not a cost-plus business, although we do seek, of course, to protect the margin structure by moving through changes in commodities and other costs.  But we very much foresee as experience and history -- who was it? Mark Twain said, history doesn't repeat itself, it just rhymes. But when you go into high inflation, consumers come under pressure. There's clearly reductions in real purchasing power going on for some segments of the population, if not everyone around the world. And so our focus is very much to find those packaging and price options by channel where we can stay connected to people who are coming under purchasing power pressure, very much the affordability just building on the Latin America example for the last question; a lot of focus on returnable, refillable bottles because the economics of those packages work to an extent that you can have a lower price point for the package. And with reductions in purchasing power, we very much see the actual out-of-pocket price point and keeping a low entry point into the category is very important, also pushing the expansion of refillables in places like South Africa. So very much acting on the signs of consumer purchasing power pressure, but very much also anticipating that it will increase. It would be great if there were a perfect landing out of this inflationary environment. The rhyme of history would tell you that at some point, either inflation or reduction in purchasing power or supply constraints eventually create a bump. And at that point, we will want to both be accessing the premium opportunities that have but very much with an anchor in the affordability and entry price point opportunities and necessities as consumers come under pressure. Our next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. When I think about -- just to approach to capital allocation and business reinvestment, as you talked about it in the prepared remarks, you framed it as essentially unchanged as a framework. But with all the variability you called out in the operating environment, I guess I'm curious as to where there are areas of your going in plans where maybe you pulled back a bit versus other areas where you found yourself now leading in more? Maybe James, to your answer to the last question, maybe it's affordability or something like that. But just again, over my sense is it's moving around a lot under the cover. So just I'm curious how that kind of agility is manifesting in terms of reallocations of", "doc_id": "de2994f4-2dbd-42a1-808d-90e68ef12233", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ecbd481d5c45d146eb3177fce9bb3e42850b6264809487fc8374adb474656c0a", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 254843, "end": 259208, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96714939-cfe7-4621-b6aa-94fae9289ebf", "2": "4bcd46d8-77f8-47ba-bc4f-ac790f73d8d5", "3": "32a8501c-f486-47bc-a8d0-7e998ac73a60"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "32a8501c-f486-47bc-a8d0-7e998ac73a60": {"__data__": {"text": "curious how that kind of agility is manifesting in terms of reallocations of spend. Thanks, Steve, it's John. Let me first just lay the picture of total capital allocation. The first priority is to invest in the business. And as we -- as James just said, when you think about the environment that we're -- we have been dealing in and we will be dealing with the rest of the year, the name of the game right now is to do exactly that is to continue to invest in our brands so that we have the wherewithal to manage through whatever comes at us. I think at a local level, the mix of investments is something that we continue to be very flexible with. And we are leveraging the work that we have been doing over the last couple of years to be even more effective in how we're spending our marketing dollars, whether it's on building our brands or whether it's on supporting our RGM efforts in the marketplace. The other areas of our capital allocation framework, supporting the dividend, looking at opportunistic M&A and share repurchase, we covered in the script with the dividend and share repurchase, we continue to be very open as to what opportunities may be out there. But in the here and now, the top priority is investing appropriately in the business. And as I say, the mix of that investment is something that varies and will continue to vary depending on what we need to do locally. Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. I had just a big picture question about how you're working with your bottlers who are experiencing pretty sharp cost pressures to essentially help them navigate through this tough environment, if you guys could talk about that. And also looking at the equity income in the quarter, it remained relatively strong, but is the expectation going forward that there will be a greater impact in the next couple of quarters, given some of these pressures? Yes. Sure, Bonnie. I mean I'm not sure it would be appropriate to comment on equity income into the future for our bottling partners. But as we go into a tough environment, as we always do historically, we make sure that we intensify our collaboration and partnership with our bottlers, both to work on what are the marketing programs and the innovation programs that are going to work in the consumer and the retail environment that we face wherever we are in the world, and also the execution initiatives and focus areas that bottlers can drive on. Because firstly, the environment is not the same in every country around the world. Some are opening up exuberantly and actually chasing and keeping up with demand and the kind of the reopening euphoria, all the way across the spectrum to parts of China like Shanghai, which is in full lockdown as though it were April 2020. So the environment is absolutely not the same in every country, and we have to work where on the curve of all the change, are we and be very clear. And in terms of the pressures, you talked about it, the pressure is both headwind and tailwind. Clearly, there are headwinds in terms of cost, whether it be commodities, logistics, wages. And as I said earlier in one of the questions, we work with our system, our bottling partners, to make sure we protect and sustain the margin structure over time. That's not necessarily true every single quarter, but that is our overall objective: earning the right to price the brands so that the system has the sort of margin structure and stability of that over the course of time, if not every single quarter. But there are headwinds there. Balancing those headwinds, there are tailwinds out there, as I said. The reopenings provide fuel not just for overall demand, but improvements in channels, away-from-home channels where we're strong and leaning in with investment produces great results. So this is -- there's a lot of variables at play in the downhill of the year and really just the key is the intense partnership with our bottlers to make the most of the opportunity ahead of us and to prepare ourselves for step 2 and step 3 further down the road. Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. James, I wanted to just circle back to the comments you made in the prepared remarks about ESG and, I guess, tying it to comp. If I understood the proxy correctly,", "doc_id": "32a8501c-f486-47bc-a8d0-7e998ac73a60", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "87c830752b809c316ccb8bf27f292ad1e750e459d64754f27c8d0a12d28345a9", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 259224, "end": 263531, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96714939-cfe7-4621-b6aa-94fae9289ebf", "2": "de2994f4-2dbd-42a1-808d-90e68ef12233", "3": "b7d76bfb-c395-4e24-9918-2912e7e1345a"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "b7d76bfb-c395-4e24-9918-2912e7e1345a": {"__data__": {"text": "I guess, tying it to comp. If I understood the proxy correctly, there\u2019s been 2 changes. One is the ESG component now being a portion of both the annual and long-term comp. I think it moves to 10%. And then also for your annual long-term incentive comp, the amount that's paid out in stock options, I think, goes up from like 1/3 to 1/2. So just wanted to sort of get your perspective on why make those changes now? And just what it signals about your focus going forward? Yes. Thanks, Bryan. Yes, I mean, firstly, we'd refer everyone who wants a greater depth to the proxy that's out there on our website, and we've tried to lay out some of the mechanics and our thinking behind the 2. We have made some changes, as you point out, Bryan, to the way the long-term incentives or more specifically, the performance share units, which are kind of a 3-year program. We've got a 10% element in that that's linked to our ESG goals. And so we are laying out some very specific targets that will drive a portion of those payouts. And because some of those ESG objectives take some time to execute against, we felt they were better embedded into the 3-year stock award programs. And then secondly, as you point out, with the Board and with the Compensation Committee, we felt to increase greater alignment with shareowners. We would readjust the balance of performance share units versus options for myself and push that up to 50%. I mean you can take that as a confidence in the future, but that's one very small stone on the large pile of stones of things we do to demonstrate that we believe this is a great company with a great future.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll briefly comment on our overall performance, then Jeff, Tom and Rob will review our first quarter business highlights, pipeline progress and financial results in more detail. I'm pleased with the excellent start to 2022. It further reinforces our confidence in the long-term fundamentals of the business. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.16, exceeding our expectations. Total net revenue of more than $13.5 billion was up 5.4% on an operational basis, also above our expectations. These results demonstrate strong momentum across several key products and portfolios, including robust double-digit operational revenue growth from Skyrizi, Rinvoq, Neuroscience and Aesthetics. Skyrizi is performing exceptionally well. We are achieving impressive market share gains in psoriasis, which remains a significant market opportunity. Skyrizi's recent launch in psoriatic arthritis as well as the anticipated regulatory approval in Crohn's disease should also serve as important growth drivers over the long-term. Rinvoq is also contributing compelling sales growth. Subscription trends in RA have recently stabilized as we expected and we are making excellent progress repositioning the brand as the leading second-line agent based on the robust data generated across our broad development programs. The early launch trends for Rinvoq in both atopic dermatitis and psoriatic arthritis are highly encouraging, with commercial access and paid prescriptions expected to ramp significantly over the coming months. We anticipate that these two new indications, along with the recent US approval in ulcerative colitis, should add substantial revenue growth for Rinvoq over the long term. Neuroscience remains an exciting opportunity for our company. Vraylar continues to have strong momentum across our currently approved indications and the pending regulatory approval in major depressive disorder represents a significant upside to current projections. In migraine, our portfolio of distinct therapies with Ubrelvy, Qulipta and Botox Therapeutic is demonstrating robust double-digit sales growth. With the migraine market anticipated to roughly double in size over the next several years, there is significant headroom for continued revenue growth with these compelling therapies. Aesthetics is once again exceeding expectations. The category continues to grow robust double-digits, especially in toxins and fillers, where there is substantial opportunity for further market penetration. Our commercial team is executing at a high level with targeted promotion and enhanced digital services, including our Alle loyalty program driving strong market share performance across our major brands. In summary, this is an exciting time for AbbVie, and I'm extremely pleased with the evolution and momentum of our diverse portfolio. We're making excellent progress with the launches of several new products and indications, which will collectively add meaningful revenue for AbbVie as commercial access ramps for each of these opportunities over the remainder of this year. We're off to another exceptional start, and our long-term growth prospects remain strong. I'd now like to take a brief moment to thank Mike Severino for his contributions to the success of AbbVie over the last eight years. As you know, Mike has decided to leave AbbVie at the end of May to pursue another career opportunity, and we wish him all the best. I'd also like to take this opportunity to formally introduce to you Tom Hudson. Tom joined AbbVie back in 2016 as the Head of Discovery and Early Development. In 2018, Tom undertook responsibilities for AbbVie's entire discovery organization. Then in 2019, was promoted to the Head of AbbVie R&D and Chief Scientific Officer, where he assumed responsibility for all of AbbVie's R&D. Tom has an impressive background as a clinical scientist. His medical specialty is in clinical immunology and allergy.

Tom was also instrumental in the international half map project to refine the genetic architecture of the human genome. Tom went on to further lead the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, which included discovery and translational cancer research with a clinical network of more than 1,000 investigators. Tom will be providing an update on our continued pipeline progress to you later in the call. But first, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff? Thank you, Rick. We continue to demonstrate strong commercial execution across our therapeutic portfolio. I'll start with Immunology, which delivered global revenues of more than $6.1 billion, reflecting growth of 8.1% on an operational basis. Humira global sales were approximately $4.7 billion, down 1.8% on an operational basis with low single-digit revenue growth in the US, offset by biosimilar competition across international markets, where revenues were down 17.9% operationally.  Skyrizi global revenues were $940 million, reflecting positive momentum in both approved indications. In psoriasis, Skyrizi is demonstrating impressive market share gains globally. Skyrizi now accounts for approximately 23% of the total prescription share in the US biologic market. Skyrizi's in-play psoriasis share, which includes both new and switching patients, also remains very, very strong and now reflects roughly 40% patient share in the US and a clear number one leadership position.  Skyrizi is performing exceptionally well internationally, where we have now achieved approximately 10% psoriasis share across our top 12 markets, as well as in-play share leadership in more than 20 key countries. While we were early in our launch in psoriatic arthritis, we are encouraged by the uptake in this indication. In the dermatology segment, Skyrizi has already achieved in-play patient share of more than 10% in the US.  Internationally, Skyrizi PSA is now approved in 45 countries, with reimbursement expected to increase throughout the year. Importantly, we are also preparing for the launch of Skyrizi in Crohn's disease, which represents another important long-term growth driver with approval decisions anticipated this year.  Turning now to Rinvoq, which delivered global sales of $465 million, demonstrating continued strong growth. As anticipated, we have seen an impact on new patient starts following the label update and Rinvoq prescriptions have now stabilized in the U.S., with in-play market share currently 12% in RA. We expect growth in the second line plus RA setting going forward where our field force is now focused on leveraging compelling data from two important Phase III trials.  First, SELECT-CHOICE, which demonstrated Rinvoq's superiority versus ORENCIA across key efficacy parameters, including clinical remission in previously treated RA patients. And second, the open-label extension of SELECT-COMPARE which demonstrated that many RA patients with an inadequate response to Humira are able to achieve remission after switching to Rinvoq.  Early feedback suggests this updated Rinvoq RA messaging is resonating very well with healthcare practitioners. Internationally, Rinvoq share continues to ramp in RA with a total market share of approximately 5.5% across key geographies. We are also making excellent progress with Rinvoq's newly launched indications, including atopic dermatitis, psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis.  Managed care access is expected to ramp strongly for each of these indications over the coming months. As we build access, initial prescriptions are covered by our BRIDGE program. which provides free patients or free goods to patients until formulary coverage is established. As a reminder, the volume from our BRIDGE program is not captured in third-party prescription data.  I'll start with atopic dermatitis. We are seeing new patient starts accelerating as we build access. When you include prescriptions from our Bridge program, Rinvoq total in-play AD share is already in the mid-teens. So, we are pleased with the early adoption and repeating prescribers.

As an oral option that provides significant skin clearance and itch relief, we believe Rinvoq has a strong differentiated position in this highly underpenetrated AD market. In PSA, we are seeing a nice uptake in Rinvoq's in-play share, especially in the rheum segment, where the severity of joint or skin manifestations of the disease can vary significantly by patients. And importantly, we have also launched Skyrizi in the rheum-PSA segment this quarter, giving us two very compelling therapies to address the wide range of PSA patient types, regardless of how their symptoms present. We have also launched our first indication in the IBD segment, Rinvoq for ulcerative colitis, where we are seeing a significant long-term opportunity in the second-line plus setting. Nearly 50% of UC patients are currently on or have used TNF therapy, so the addressable patient population is substantial. Given the strong benefit risk in this indication, we believe Rinvoq will be a welcome therapeutic option for UC patients and physicians. Turning now to hematologic oncology. Global revenues were more than $1.6 billion, down 0.6% on an operational basis. Imbruvica global revenues were approximately $1.2 billion, down 7.4%. There are two factors impacting our Imbruvica results. First, we are seeing greater market share erosion in new patient starts than originally anticipated from newer therapy, including other BTK inhibitors, as well as our own Venclexta. Second, we continue to see higher-than-expected COVID suppression on new patient starts in CLL, which as a treat-to-progression therapy, has impacted the total BTK treated patient market. Our guidance assumes a market recovery over the course of this year, but it's too early to determine exactly how this may play out, given the continued impact from recent COVID variant. Despite these dynamics, Imbruvica remains the market-leading therapy for total patients across CLL and several other major blood cancers. Based on the magnitude of clinical data and real-world evidence generated for Imbruvica, showing sustained disease control as well as overall patient survival, we are confident it will continue to be a meaningful product for AbbVie over the long term. Venclexta, however, is helping to offset some of the headwinds facing Imbruvica. Global sales were $473 million, up 21.1% on an operational basis. In the US, Venclexta's the clear market share leader in frontline AML, among patients who are ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy and recently achieved leading new patient share in second line plus PLL. We are also seeing robust momentum internationally, with strong performance across all approved indications. Additionally, we continue to make excellent progress building out our hem/onc portfolio, with several compelling late-stage assets, such as epcoritamab for B-cell malignancies, Navitoclax for myelofibrosis and ABBV-383 for multiple myeloma, expected support -- expected to support sustainable long-term growth. Turning now to neuroscience, where revenues were approximately $1.5 billion, up more than 20% on an operational basis, including robust double-digit growth from Vraylar, Botox Therapeutic and Ubrelvy. Ubrelvy is performing very well and continues to be the market-leading oral CGRP treatment for acute migraine, with sequential demand growth observed. Qulipta is also demonstrating exceptional uptake in migraine prevention, with recent total prescriptions performing ahead of comparable branded launches. Qulipta is now capturing nearly 25% on of the new-to-brand share in the US preventative CGRP class when we consider both paid and bridge volume. We expect commercial access to continue to ramp strongly over the remainder of the year. Qulipta has also recently demonstrated positive results from a registration-enabling study for the preventative treatment of chronic migraine, which we plan to submit to the agency for potential expanded use in the US as well as to support regulatory applications across the international", "doc_id": "417d89b6-665e-4e57-b629-66e814d5a1c1", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "440d19f21bf148d8061a7f85c33ef19f775410145fd6900d27aae0276bb15cb8", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 276009, "end": 280060, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96714939-cfe7-4621-b6aa-94fae9289ebf", "2": "8aaa2381-f83c-49cd-85da-6900c149c36a", "3": "b6aab96c-6150-4536-98ae-b467a45bb184"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "b6aab96c-6150-4536-98ae-b467a45bb184": {"__data__": {"text": "expanded use in the US as well as to support regulatory applications across the international market. This indication, if approved, will provided added differentiation for Qulipta as the only oral CGRP therapy for the preventative treatment of both episodic and chronic migraine. In our other notable therapeutic, eye care revenues of $771 million were down 2.8% on an operational basis with recent generic competition for Restasis unfavorably impacting our results. Mavyret sales were $380 million, down 4.6% on an operational basis as treated patient volumes remain depressed compared to pre-COVID levels. So, overall, I'm extremely pleased with our execution across the therapeutic portfolio, including the progress we are making with recent new product launches. We remain on-track to deliver strong revenue growth once again in 2022. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom for additional comments on our R&D program. Tom? Thank you, Jeff. I'll start with immunology. We recently received FDA approval for Rinvoq in ulcerative colitis, a disease where there continues to be a significant unmet need for therapies that can provide high response rates and durable remission. In our UC development program, Rinvoq demonstrated some of the highest rates of remission and endoscopic improvements seen in Phase 3 studies. Importantly, Rinvoq also provided durable responses sustained through one year of treatment. Given the strong benefit risk profile, we believe Rinvoq will be an important new medicine for patients. Our regulatory applications for Rinvoq in UC remain under review in Europe and Japan, with approval decisions expected in the second half of this year. Also in the area of inflammatory bowel disease, we recently reported positive topline results from the second Phase 3 induction study for Rinvoq in Crohn's disease. Similar to results from the first induction trial, in this induction study, Rinvoq demonstrated a very strong impact on the disease as measured by clinical remission and endoscopic response. We expect to see results from the Phase 3 maintenance study later in the quarter with our regulatory submissions for Rinvoq and Crohn's disease expected in the third quarter and approval decisions anticipated in 2023. Rounding out Rinvoq's development programs in rheumatology, we also have regulatory applications under review in ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial SpA. We expect an FDA approval decision in the second quarter for AS and decisions in the fourth quarter for non-radiographic axial SpA. Moving to Skyrizi, where in the quarter, we announced an update regarding our regulatory application for Crohn's disease in the US. Following an FDA request for additional information, primarily related to the on-body injection device used for maintenance dosing, we provided additional data for the device from an ongoing real-life use study, which showed that patients can safely and effectively use the on-body device to self-administer Skyrizi. After responding to the agency's request, we received a 3-month extension of our Skyrizi submission in Crohn's disease. We remain confident in a strong benefit risk profile for Skyrizi in Crohn's disease and we now expect a decision in June. Moving now to our Oncology Portfolio, where we continue to make excellent progress across all stages of our heme and solid tumor pipeline. We recently announced positive top line results from the first expansion cohort of the Phase II study, evaluating epcoritamab in patients with aggressive B-cell lymphoma who have received at least two prior lines of therapy.  Epcoritamab performed extremely well as a monotherapy in these heavily pretreated and high-risk patients, demonstrating an overall response rate of 63% with a median duration of response of 12 months. These results are particularly encouraging, given that nearly 40% of patients had failed CAR-T therapy. We plan to discuss these results with regulatory agencies about the potential to support submission for accelerated approval in the second half of this year. We continue to make good progress with the indication expansion programs for Venclexta and remain on-track to", "doc_id": "b6aab96c-6150-4536-98ae-b467a45bb184", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "00d9750dc407e7c5bc80e0f1366b7e36fe35597ae63ff4f215d94e79524a7328", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 280060, "end": 284239, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96714939-cfe7-4621-b6aa-94fae9289ebf", "2": "417d89b6-665e-4e57-b629-66e814d5a1c1", "3": "409b6640-8e7d-4141-b070-24e65d8969b5"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "409b6640-8e7d-4141-b070-24e65d8969b5": {"__data__": {"text": "with the indication expansion programs for Venclexta and remain on-track to see results from the Phase III CANOVA trial in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients with a t(11;14) mutation in the second half of this year. In our Venclexta MDS program, based on feedback from the FDA, we have recently modified our regulatory strategy and now intend to submit data from our ongoing Phase III program. Venclexta remains under Breakthrough Therapy Designation for MDS and we continue to have a high degree of enthusiasm for Venclexta in this indication. We expect data readout from the Phase III study and our regulatory submission for MDS in 2024. In Neuroscience, the FDA recently accepted our application for Vraylar as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder. Based on the strong benefit-risk profile demonstrated in our clinical program, we believe Vraylar will be an important new therapy in this patient population, and we look forward to bringing this new treatment option to patients suffering from major depressive disorders.  In the area of migraine, we recently reported positive topline results from a Phase III study evaluating Qulipta for the prevention of chronic migraine. Qulipta performed very well in this study with both doses meeting the primary and all secondary endpoints, demonstrating Qulipta's ability to significantly reduce migraine days for patients suffering from chronic migraine.  This summer, we plan to submit our regulatory application to the FDA for Qulipta in chronic migraine and also plan to submit data from our Phase III studies in both chronic migraine and episodic migraine to support regulatory applications in markets outside the US. In our cystic fibrosis program, we recently completed an interim analysis of a Phase II proof-of-concept study evaluating our triple combination therapy. The results \u2013 the efficacy results from this interim analysis did not meet our prespecified criteria for advancing this triple therapy in development. This study was designed with a 28-day run-in treatment period, with a dual combination therapy containing our C1 corrector and potentiator, followed by a 28-day treatment period, with a triple combination, which included the addition of our C2 corrector, ABBV-119. This allowed us to independently assess the therapeutic potential of our C2 corrector. The results showed that the addition of 119 did not provide a meaningful improvement in FEV1 or reduction in sweat chloride concentration over our dual combination therapy. During the run-in treatment period, we were able to again assess the efficacy of our dual therapy, which performed well, providing efficacy consistent with results for the existing dual accommodation therapy. So based on the performance of our dual therapy, we plan to continue our CF program. We have an additional C2 corrector, ABBV-576 in Phase 1 studies that we plan to advance into a new triple therapy with our existing C1 corrector and potentiator. 576 is structurally distinct from our previous C2 corrector 119 and has a better PK profile and provides higher drug exposure, which has the potential to deliver better efficacy. Our plan is to begin a Phase 2 study for this new triple combo by early next year. And in Aesthetics, we recently began the Phase 3 program for our short-acting toxin in Glabellar Lines. This novel toxin is designed to provide rapid onset of action and a short duration of effect, which would lower the barrier for adoption for certain segment of consumers. We expect to see data from this program next year with regulatory applications also anticipated in 2023. So in summary, we've continued to make significant progress with our pipeline to start the year, and we look forward to many more data readouts, regulatory submissions and approvals throughout the remainder of 2022. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our first quarter performance and financial outlook. Rob? Thank you, Tom. AbbVie's first quarter results demonstrate the strength of our broad portfolio, including double-digit growth from Skyrizi, Rinvoq, Venclexta, Neuroscience and Aesthetics.

We also continue to deliver strong P&L performance, with another quarter of robust operating margin expansion, while fully funding the business for long-term growth. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.16, reflecting growth of 9.3% compared to prior year and $0.04 above our guidance midpoint. This includes an $0.08 unfavorable impact of acquired IPR&D expense that was not factored into our original guidance. Total net revenues were more than $13.5 billion, up 5.4% on an operational basis, excluding a 1.3% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Net revenues came in above our guidance despite the entry of generic competition for Restasis. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 51.4% of sales, an improvement of 150 basis points versus the prior year. This includes adjusted gross margin of 84.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 10.9% of sales, acquired IPR&D expense of 1.1% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of 21.1% of sales. Net interest expense was $539 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 12.1%. Turning to our financial outlook, we are updating our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to include the $0.08 for acquired IPR&D expense that was incurred during the first quarter. As a result, we now expect full year adjusted earnings per share between $13.92 and $14.12. This earnings per share guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred beyond the first quarter. We now expect net revenues of approximately $59.4 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.4% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. This revenue guidance includes updated Restasis sales of approximately $400 million. Moving to the P&L, we now expect adjusted gross margin of 84.5% of sales, adjusted SG&A expense of $12.5 billion, and an adjusted operating margin ratio of 51.8% of sales. Turning to the second quarter, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $14.6 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.5% unfavorable impact on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.38 and $3.42. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. In closing, we are off to an excellent start to the year with strong performance across multiple areas. We are making significant progress with new product launches and the pipeline, underscoring our confidence in AbbVie's long-term growth outlook. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz. Thanks, Rob. We will now open the call for questions. In the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or two. Operator, we'll take the first question, please. Thank you. Our first question comes from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Your line is open Great. Thanks for taking my question. And maybe to begin with on Imbruvica. So, I mean, the script trends are down, and you mentioned that we are -- for new starts, you are losing some share to the competition. When you think -- can you please characterize how much share you are losing? And do you think it will stabilize over time? And when you look at Imbruvica and Venclexta combined, do you think the franchise can grow going forward from here? Thank you. Yes. Thank you for the question. So, as I mentioned in my comments, we are seeing greater share erosion. Imbruvica continues to be the leading share in the later lines, although we have lost our frontline share position to Calquence. And obviously, Venclexta is also moving there. So we see a couple of things that are taking place. So, we have that share erosion that's putting some pressure on the brand. And then clearly, we see the continued suppression of the market. So, it's kind of like a double hit. If we think of this over", "doc_id": "13bbc7e1-7773-434d-9c09-95c1e5658589", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "fe958650c425d483e763c3650399e17c3ad3ed4220950e5c5e83074503a2f974", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 288444, "end": 292335, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96714939-cfe7-4621-b6aa-94fae9289ebf", "2": "409b6640-8e7d-4141-b070-24e65d8969b5", "3": "28c5579d-5348-4921-a8da-e45d9ab99d89"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "28c5579d-5348-4921-a8da-e45d9ab99d89": {"__data__": {"text": "the market. So, it's kind of like a double hit. If we think of this over the short, mid and longer term, what I would say would be this. So, in the short-term, meaning this year, we projected the share decline and that includes some stabilization, but we still think the brand is under some pressure from other BTKs and Venclexta. And basically, we have flat guidance this year. And some of that includes a recovery of the market back to sort of more normal levels and we'll have to see how that progresses over the year. If I think more about the midterm, I think what's important context there is, new patient starts essentially make up roughly 13% to 15% of Imbruvica. So it's got a very, very large installed base, about 85%, maybe a little bit more in terms of what that's going to happen. We're not seeing any changes in persistency or items like that. So we think that we have a very good sense of stability for the brand over time in terms of what this may mean. And so that's basically how we think about it. To answer your other question, if you look at the combined share, AbbVie has quite a strong position. We have roughly 33% of total share in the front line and we have between 42% and 46% of second-line plus. So clearly, Venclexta is able to offset as I commented in my remarks some of those pressures. So it's very important for AbbVie. It's going to be a very big brand over the long term. In the short term here in midterm, the growth is going to be more challenged moving forward. Thank you.  Thanks, Mohit. Operator, next question please. Thank you. Our next question comes from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Hi, thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering, obviously, you guys have been speaking with payers about the Humira positioning for 2023. Are you willing to give us any update in terms of how you're thinking about that guidance figure that you put out a couple of years ago? Any change in thinking there? And then are you able to disclose the CR rate for the recent epcoritamab Phase II trial? Just wondering how that, factors into the decision about whether to seek accelerated approval here? Thank you. So Terence, this is Rick. I'll take the first for you. And I'm probably going to answer a little broader because I think it is important. I understand the interest in trying to understand how to model 2023, it's obviously important to us to model 2023 as accurately as possible. And I think if you step back, obviously, contracting is one portion of a variable that will impact the speed at which biosimilars are able to adopt \u2013 be adopted in the market.  If you step back and look, there's probably four key variables that will impact, what that adoption rate looks like. One of them is obviously, what will Humira's access be post biosimilars entering the marketplace? And this is the period where you would normally be doing the contracting around that. I think we'll do well in being able to be co-positioned versus biosimilars in the vast majority of covered lives here in the United States. But that process isn't done, and we're not in a position to be able to ultimately, give you any further update until we're a little further along in that process.  The second variable that will impact what 2023 looks like is, how will the biosimilars price? We don't know that. Obviously, we have seen how they price in markets outside the US, but there's no market exactly like the US internationally. And so that's a variable. We're making some projections of what we believe that pricing will look like. But that's ultimately something we're going to have to see how it plays out.  I'd say the third variable is, how competitive will these biosimilars be? It's going to be by the summer of 2023, there's going to be a lot of biosimilars in the US market, but they're not all the same. And how competitive will they be against what is Humira today? And what are the bulk of patients use as it relates to Humira. And what I mean by that is interchangeability and a number of going to play into the competitiveness of those biosimilars. And I'd", "doc_id": "28c5579d-5348-4921-a8da-e45d9ab99d89", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "0434ad88a4553bcd715a80f9d170afc5b9ee3ab666f7b0a4803d394bb7d9beb2", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 292344, "end": 296455, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96714939-cfe7-4621-b6aa-94fae9289ebf", "2": "13bbc7e1-7773-434d-9c09-95c1e5658589", "3": "d74b2698-c95e-4216-8e17-0a64e5f2c98f"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "d74b2698-c95e-4216-8e17-0a64e5f2c98f": {"__data__": {"text": "number of going to play into the competitiveness of those biosimilars. And I'd say the fourth variable, and it's not something that people think about that much, and that is the ability of a biosimilar to be able to supply the US market. There's no market like the United States for Humira anywhere around the world. In the United States, it's significantly larger than any other market around the world. There are certainly biosimilar players that are like an AbbVie, and I would expect them to have manufacturing capacity. There are generic players that could have sufficient manufacturing capacity, and then there are very small companies. But I think anybody -- any payer that's going to want to convert in any significant way to a biosimilar, they're going to want confidence that they can have a reliability of supply of that biosimilar and we've spent years building the network that we have. We have full redundancy of every aspect of the manufacturing process on Humira. And we've never had a problem supplying the US market. So, I think we can be viewed as kind of the gold standard. So, those are the variables that are going to impact what this transition looks like. The guidance we've given so far is this 45%, plus or minus 10%. I think at this point, that's still the best information that we can provide. Later this year, I think some of these variables will be clearer to it. And we may be in a position to be able to provide some more information to investors, and we would do that. Some will not. Pricing will not be clear at that point. We're not going to know how they're going to price until we actually get into -- they actually get into the marketplace. So, I think that's the way to think about these variables. Rob, anything you'd add? Yes. So, this is Rob. I would just add that we've been trying to give investors some directional guidance on how to think about 2023 beyond just the Humira, 45% plus or minus 10%. We've talked about Aesthetics growing high single-digits annually over the next decade. You can get a sense based on Jeff's response today and the way to think about Imbruvica, in terms of operating margin, I've talked about that pulling back to the 46% to 47% range with no cuts to investment because we're going to return to grow, ['Terence Flynn', 'Rick Gonzalez', 'Liz Shea', 'Mohit Bansal', 'Jeff Stewart', 'Tom Hudson', 'Operator', 'Rob Michael']\n9, DIS, 1, 2022, 2022-02-09 19:57:09, Good day, and thank you for standing by.

I'd now like to hand the conference over to Jenn Kettnich, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Walt Disney Company. Please go ahead. Good afternoon, and it's my pleasure to welcome everyone to The Walt Disney Company's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is also being webcast and we'll post a transcript of this call to our website. Joining me today are Bob Chapek, Disney's Chief Executive Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Christine, we'll be happy to take some of your questions.  So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to get started. Thanks, Jenn, and good afternoon, everyone. As we begin the final year of The Walt Disney Company's first century, I am pleased to share our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2022, starting with the highlights. Our adjusted EPS of $1.06 is up from $0.32 a year ago. Our Domestic Parks and Resorts achieved all-time revenue and operating income records despite the Omicron surge. And our streaming services ended Q1 with 196.4 million total subscriptions after adding 70.4 million in the quarter, including 11.8 million Disney+ subscribers. I'll share more about those items shortly. But first, I want to talk about this unique moment in the history of The Walt Disney Company.

We have the world's most creative storytelling engine, an unmatched collection of brands and franchises and an ability to tell stories that form deep emotional connections with audiences. We have a portfolio of distribution platforms, including powerful and growing streaming services. We have diverse revenue streams that span business models and industries, but which all are interconnected to create entertainment's most powerful synergy machine. We have the country's top news organization and the most trusted brand for following sports and our theme parks continue to be the most magical places on earth. In short, our collection of assets and platforms, creative capabilities in unique place and the cultural zeitgeist give me great confidence that we will continue to define entertainment for the next 100 years. To carry through on that promise, we will be guided by 3 strategic pillars: storytelling excellence, innovation and audience focus. Storytelling excellence is, of course, dependent on having excellent storytellers. I am thrilled to share that our legacy of being home to the most accomplished leaders in the industry will continue, as nearly all of our top creative executives have recently renewed, extended or signed new contracts. I could not be more excited to continue working with these creative powerhouses. The quality content from our teams was recognized just yesterday with a fantastic 23 Oscar nominations, including 3 of the 5 best animated feature films: Pixar's Luca; Walt Disney Animation's Raya and the Last Dragon; and our newest franchise, Walt Disney Animation's Encanto, which received 3 nominations. Summer of Soul was recognized in the best documentary category, and Nightmare Alley and West Side Story both received best picture nominations. As you may have seen earlier today, we announced West Side Story will debut in most Disney+ markets on March 2 and we can't wait for our subscribers to see this incredible film. In Q1, our studios took us deeper into the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Eternals and the Disney+ original series, Hawkeye. And returned us to that galaxy far, far away with another Disney+ original series of Book of Boba Fett. Our general entertainment teams also continued to produce programming of the highest quality. In fact, last year, our general entertainment team produced nearly 1/4 of the industry's best review shows. And Q1 saw 10 of their shows achieved a 100% critic score on Rotten Tomatoes. That includes Abbott Elementary, the first Freshman Broadcast comedy to earn the 100% certified fresh score since ABC's own Modern Family in 2009. Our success in branded storytelling is, of course, no secret. However, it's often lost that the depth, breadth and quality of our general entertainment content is also a driving force behind the success of our streaming services. In fact, 6 of the 10 most watched programs across our services are general entertainment titles produced by our own team. And general entertainment is an increasingly powerful driver of engagement in most of our international markets where such content is already included in our service under the Star brand. Going forward, integrating more owned general entertainment into our services, especially Disney+, will be a priority. In fact, just today, we added episodes of Grown-ish, Blackish and the Wonder Years to our domestic Disney+ service. Rounding out our content focuses, is of course, sports.  Sporting events continue to be the most powerful draw in television accounting for 95 of the 100 most watched live broadcast in 2021, and ESPN once again set the bar this quarter with live games across each of our 4 major U.S. sports, including the revolutionary Monday Night with Peyton and Eli. And I am pleased to announce that we have expanded our agreement with Peyton Manning and its Omaha Productions Company to extend our relationship through the", "doc_id": "a36746cc-9fd0-483b-8d50-eef364667ebd", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "d170421c5ca137653e14d0930c83272e0a9688d148ac910249148ae4f6ab0d6d", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 300578, "end": 305041, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96714939-cfe7-4621-b6aa-94fae9289ebf", "2": "d74b2698-c95e-4216-8e17-0a64e5f2c98f", "3": "b8d19787-8bdd-473e-92a2-4ce28a87e433"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "b8d19787-8bdd-473e-92a2-4ce28a87e433": {"__data__": {"text": "Manning and its Omaha Productions Company to extend our relationship through the 2024 NFL season, and we'll add alternative presentations for UFC golf and college football events for each of the next 3 years. While multiplatform television and streaming will continue to be the foundation of sports coverage for the immediate future, we believe the opportunity for The Walt Disney Company goes well beyond these channels. It extends to sports betting, gaming and the metaverse. In fact, that's what excites us, the opportunity to build a sports machine akin to our franchise flywheel that enables audiences to experience, connect with and become actively engaged with our favorite sporting events, stories, teams and players. Turning to distribution results. The continued growth of our streaming services was certainly a standout. Our success at Disney+ this quarter was not the result of any one item, but instead a combination of organic growth and powerful new content, our strategic decision to include the Disney bundle with all Hulu Live subscriptions and new market launches. The remainder of this fiscal year will feature compelling Disney+ originals from across our brands and franchises, beginning with Pixar's Turning Red and Marvel Studios Moon Night in March. And the back half of FY '22 will feature a truly stunning array of content, including 2 Star Wars series: Andor, and the highly anticipated Obi-Wan Kenobi, which I am excited to announce will premiere on May 25. We'll debut 2 Marvel series, Ms. Marvel and She-Hulk; fresh new shorts from Disney Animation and Pixar, featuring the worlds of Big Hero 6 and Cars; a live-action reimagining of the Disney Classic Pinocchio, starring Tom Hanks as Geppetto; and one of the most anticipated sequels in some time, especially in the Chapek household, Hocus Pocus 2. As I've said before, we continue to manage our services for the long term and maintain confidence in our guidance of 230 million to 260 million total paid Disney+ subscribers globally by the end of fiscal 2024. Christine will provide more detail into our theatrical results. However, I want to reiterate that we continue to see value in the moviegoing experience, especially for big franchise blockbusters. And given the performance of titles like Spider- No Way Home, we are looking forward to kicking off our summer slate with another Marvel franchise film, Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. That said, audiences will be our North Star as we determine how our content is distributed. And we do not subscribe to the belief that theatrical distribution is the only way to build a Disney franchise. This quarter, audience has proved us right, as Encanto became a phenomenon within days of its arrival on Disney+ after families continued reluctance to return to theaters resulted in a muted theatrical performance. With outstanding music from Lin-Manuel Miranda, it became the fastest titled across 200 million hours viewed on Disney+ and took social media by storm. People around the world expressed their fandom through their own content and conversation and the Encanto hashtag has been viewed more than 11 billion times. The sound track, which debuted at #197 on the Billboard 200 Chart reached #1 shortly after debuting on Disney+ and 8 of the film songs hit the Hot 100 Chart, including We Don't Talk About Bruno, which became the first Disney song to reach #1 since Aladdin\u2019s Whole New World in 1993. At the same time, sales of Encanto merchandise defied traditional post-holiday declines and actually increased following the film's release on Disney+ on Christmas Eve and guests at Disney California Adventure have loved seeing Mirabel in real life. These results are exactly what you would expect from the launch of a new Disney franchise and we are thrilled that Disney+ was the catalyst. We are more confident than ever in this platform as a content service, a franchise engine and as a venue for the next generation of Disney storytelling. Finally, I could not be more pleased with the performance of our Parks, Experiences and Products segment, which posted its second best quarter of all time. Over the last several years, we've transformed the guest experience by investing in new storytelling and ground-breaking technology and the records at our domestic parks are", "doc_id": "b8d19787-8bdd-473e-92a2-4ce28a87e433", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "884b2a38c5fc656600775a61e60c6a0844795c1e6ec64b148d3635d8f69aa2e2", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 305045, "end": 309363, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96714939-cfe7-4621-b6aa-94fae9289ebf", "2": "a36746cc-9fd0-483b-8d50-eef364667ebd", "3": "73a3f1a0-be7c-48f3-aeb3-c38ac831b851"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "73a3f1a0-be7c-48f3-aeb3-c38ac831b851": {"__data__": {"text": "in new storytelling and ground-breaking technology and the records at our domestic parks are the direct result of this investment. From new franchise-based lands and attractions to craveable food and beverage offerings, the must-have character merchandise, there is more great Disney storytelling infused into every aspect of a visit to our parks than ever before. At the same time, we're giving guests new tools to personalize their visits and spend less time in line and more time having fun. While we anticipated these products would be popular, we have been blown away by the reception. In the quarter, more than 1/3 of domestic park guests purchased either Genie+, Lightning Lane or both. That number rose to more than 50% during the holiday period. While demand was strong throughout the quarter at both domestic sites, our reservation system enabled us to strategically manage attendance. In fact, their stellar performance was achieved at lower attendance levels than 2019. As we return to a more normalized environment, we look forward to more fully capitalizing on the extraordinary demand for our parks along with the already realized yield benefits that took shape this quarter. And we, of course, will continue to invest in the guest experience. I am personally looking forward to  Galactic Star Cruiser at Walt Disney World, a 2-night adventure into the most immersive Star Wars story ever created. We are pleased with demand for this premium ground-breaking experience, which will welcome guests starting on March 1. Later this summer, we will debut an innovative new rollercoaster at EPCOT, Guardians of the  Cosmic Rewind and Open Avengers Campus at Disneyland Paris, where the iconic Quinjet landed a few weeks ago ahead of the resort's 30th anniversary celebrations. I want to close by thanking our 195,000 employees for bringing Disney magic to audiences and guests around the world, especially in times like these, when the world needs it most. Our company is truly extraordinary, and I am honored to work with the most talented team in the industry to create the next generation of Disney stories and experiences through our focus on storytelling excellence, innovation and our audience. With that, I'll hand it over to Christine. Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.06, an increase of $0.74 from the prior year quarter. Fiscal 2022 is off to a good start as evidenced by our first quarter results and our continued progress towards more normalized operations across our businesses. At Parks, Experiences and Products, operating income was up $2.6 billion year-over-year as all of our parks and resorts around the world were open for the entirety of the fiscal first quarter. In the prior year quarter, Walt Disney World Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort were open for the entire quarter, while Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Disneyland Paris were each open for a limited number of weeks and Disneyland Resort was closed for the entire quarter. At our domestic parks, we were very pleased with the strong levels of demand we saw from both Walt Disney World and Disneyland. And as Bob mentioned, our reservation system has allowed us to strategically manage attendance. Overall, attendance trends at our domestic parks continued to strengthen in the quarter with Walt Disney World and Disneyland\u2019s Q1 attendance up double digits versus Q4, in part reflecting holiday seasonality. Per capita spending at our domestic parks was up more than 40% versus fiscal first quarter 2019 driven by a more favorable guest and ticket mix, higher food, beverage and merchandise spending and contributions from Genie+ and Lightning Light. Putting these factors together, our domestic Parks and Resorts delivered Q1 revenue and operating income exceeding pre-pandemic levels, even as we continue managing attendance to responsibly address ongoing COVID considerations. Looking ahead to Q2, our demand pipeline for domestic guests at Walt Disney World and Disneyland remained strong, benefiting from our 50th anniversary celebration at Walt Disney World and new attractions and experiences at both parks. At International Parks, a profitable first quarter reflected improving trends at Disneyland Paris.", "doc_id": "73a3f1a0-be7c-48f3-aeb3-c38ac831b851", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "a79c438a1803f5d1d5df6911584e258fade355e727472c77e8869f4cf09e7e47", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 309354, "end": 313644, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96714939-cfe7-4621-b6aa-94fae9289ebf", "2": "b8d19787-8bdd-473e-92a2-4ce28a87e433", "3": "23ef05e9-cf05-4ab4-9c0f-d4602ea985a7"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "23ef05e9-cf05-4ab4-9c0f-d4602ea985a7": {"__data__": {"text": "Parks, a profitable first quarter reflected improving trends at Disneyland Paris. We also saw improved results at Hong Kong Disneyland although the resort is now temporarily closed in response to a resurgence in COVID cases in the region. We expect International Parks will continue to be impacted by COVID-related volatility for the remainder of Q2. Moving on to our Media and Entertainment Distribution segment. First quarter operating income decreased by more than $600 million versus the prior year as revenue growth across our lines of business was more than offset by higher programming and production costs. Revenue growth in the quarter was primarily driven by increased subscription fees from our direct-to-consumer services. We also delivered record advertising revenues for the segment as we continue to see strong advertiser demand for our live sports and streaming and digital businesses. Turning to our results by line of business. At Linear Networks, you may recall that we guided to a decrease in operating income of nearly $500 million for Q1 versus the prior year. Operating income of $1.5 billion came in better than expected, primarily driven by our international channels, which I'll discuss in a minute. At our domestic channels, both Broadcasting and Cable operating income decreased in the first quarter versus the prior year. Lower results at Broadcasting were impacted by an adverse comparison to prior year political advertising revenue at our owned television stations, as we noted in the guidance we gave last quarter. At Cable, the year-over-year decrease in operating income reflected higher programming and production costs and increased marketing spend, partially offset by increases in advertising and affiliate revenue. Growth in advertising revenue was driven by ESPN as we benefited from the start of a normalized NBA calendar and increased viewership for football. ESPN advertising revenue in the first quarter was up 14% versus the prior year and second quarter-to-date domestic cash advertising sales at ESPN are currently pacing up. Total domestic affiliate revenue increased by 2% in the quarter. This was primarily driven by 6 points of growth from higher rates, offset by a 4-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. Operating income at our international channels decreased slightly versus the prior year. These results came in more than $200 million better than our prior guidance primarily due to lower programming and production costs as well as better-than-expected advertising and affiliate revenues. At Direct-to-Consumer, first quarter operating results decreased by $127 million year-over-year, driven by higher losses at Disney+ and ESPN+ partially offset by improved results at Hulu. I'll note that beginning this quarter, we are providing disclosure on our programming and production expenses by service as well as additional detail for Disney+ in our 10-Q. Operating losses at Disney+ increased versus the prior year as growth in subscription revenue was more than offset by higher programming, technology and marketing costs. We ended the quarter with nearly 130 million global paid Disney+ subscribers, reflecting over 11 million net additions from Q4. Taking a look at subscriber growth by region. We added 4.1 million paid domestic Disney+ subscribers, including a benefit of approximately 2 million incremental subscribers from our strategic decision to include Disney+ and ESPN+ as part of a Hulu Live subscription. In international markets, excluding Disney+ Hotstar, we added 5.1 million paid subscribers, primarily driven by growth in Asia Pacific and European markets. I'll note that growth in Asia included the benefit of new market launches in South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong in the quarter. Finally, we were able to resume growth in Disney+ Hotstar markets with 2.6 million paid subscriber additions in the quarter. Overall, we are pleased with Disney+ subscriber growth in the quarter and are looking forward to new market launches and a strong content slate later this year. As I've previously shared, we don't anticipate that subscriber growth will necessarily be linear from quarter-to-quarter, and we continue to expect growth in the back half of the fiscal year to exceed growth in the first half. At ESPN+, we ended the first quarter with over 21 million paid subscribers versus 17 million in Q4.

Results decreased compared to the prior year as growth in subscription revenue was more than offset by higher sports programming costs driven by the NHL and LaLiga. And at Hulu, higher subscription revenues versus the prior year were partially offset by higher programming and production costs driven by increased affiliate fees for live TV. Hulu ended the first quarter with 45.3 million paid subscribers, inclusive of 4.3 million subscribers to our Hulu Live digital MVPD service. Moving on to content sales, licensing and other. Results decreased in the first quarter versus the prior year to an operating loss of $98 million, driven by lower theatrical results and higher film impairments, partially offset by improved TV/SVOD results. As I noted last quarter, while theatres have generally reopened, we are still experiencing a prolonged recovery to the theatrical exhibition, particularly for certain genres of films, including non-branded general entertainment and family-focused animation. This dynamic contributed to increased losses in the quarter as we released more titles in Q1 this year versus the prior year, resulting in lower theatrical results. This was partially offset by income from our coproduction of Spider- No Way Home. As we look ahead, we would like to give you some context around 2 items that may impact our second quarter results. First, as we continue to increase our investment in content, we expect programming and production costs at DMED to increase versus the prior year, primarily driven by Direct-to-Consumer and Linear Networks. At Direct-to-Consumer, we expect programming and production expenses to increase by approximately $800 million to $1 billion, including programming fees for Hulu Live. At Linear Networks, we expect programming and production expenses to increase by approximately $500 million, reflecting factors including COVID-related timing shifts. We aired 4 additional NFL games at the start of the current quarter. And as a reminder, the Academy Awards will be held in Q2 of this year, while they fell into Q3 of the prior year. Second, at content sales, licensing and other, a difficult Q2 comparison to prior year TV and SVOD program sales is due in part to our strategic decision to hold more of our owned and produced content for our direct-to-consumer services. As a result, we expect operating income to be adversely impacted by more than $200 million versus the prior year quarter. With that, I'll turn it back to Jenn, and we would be happy to take your questions. Thanks, Christine. As we transition to the Q&A, let me note that since we are not physically together this afternoon, I will do my best to moderate the Q&A by directing your questions to the appropriate executive.   And with that, operator, we're ready for the first question. Our first question comes from Ben Swinburn with Morgan Stanley. And thank you for the additional disclosure. Bob, I wanted to ask you about Disney+. The U.S. subscriber base or the, I guess, the U.S. and Canadian subscriber base is larger than we would have thought. You guys have gotten to, I think, almost -- probably more than 1/3 penetrated of total broadband homes. And it's, I guess, interesting to me because it's a narrower service than the international product, which has the Star tile. So I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you see the runway still ahead in North America for that product. And then when you look at the international business, so leaving Hotstar aside, what does your research tell you about what the company needs to do to drive that business meaningfully higher? Because it deliver on your '24 guidance, that's really probably the biggest key is to get that sub base going. So I'm just curious, as you look at the plan, what are the things you think really can make that happen? Thanks, Ben. So on the Disney+ U.S. side, you mentioned that we're roughly 1/3 penetrated. We still have some headroom in each one of our major franchises in terms of those viewers, those fans that have expressed interest in subscribing. So we are not nearly tapped out on each", "doc_id": "3302c407-96dc-418f-a929-b2cc3651cdba", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "fa3d4cc60fd000ff1da871065f4e1fcd5040d3f941123b31fa72b7a7a26fc92e", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 318076, "end": 322236, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96714939-cfe7-4621-b6aa-94fae9289ebf", "2": "23ef05e9-cf05-4ab4-9c0f-d4602ea985a7", "3": "25e869f2-c850-4761-846a-be99adc93b08"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "25e869f2-c850-4761-846a-be99adc93b08": {"__data__": {"text": "have expressed interest in subscribing. So we are not nearly tapped out on each of the major franchises if someone identifies as a Lucas fan, Star Wars or as a Marvel fan or as a Disney fan. The biggest opportunity in terms of significance is with general entertainment being added to the service.  And I think you've seen just this quarter, we mentioned that today that we're adding in Grown-ish, Black-ish and a few other titles into our service. I think that will be a trend of us taking more general entertainment and moving it over to Disney+ because, as you know, about 50% -- slightly over 50% of our consumer base on Disney+ do not have kids. It's a very broad general service, of course, driven by the Disney brand and driven by families, but what we've seen time and time again is that the elasticity of Disney and its brand is much greater than we might have given it credit. And I think nowhere does this play out more, now getting into the international side of your question, than we see in Europe with the Star brand tile being the sixth brand tile within the Disney+ offering in Europe.  The other thing, though, to your question directly on international that's going to drive the international business is the predominance of local content that we are developing in order to appeal to the unique taste of each of those international markets. And I'll point out to the 340 productions that we referenced on the last call that we're developing. And by the way, we just created a new organization within our company to shepherd the development of that content so that we can maximize the chance that we get some global hits, if you will, out of some of that local content. And so we're bullish on the future of Disney+, both domestically and internationally, driven by not only additional prevalence of titles within our major franchises, but also general entertainment and specifically in the international territories local content. That's super helpful, Bob. And just curious, as a follow-up, of those 300 productions or the local originals, will we see a lot of that in fiscal '22 come on the service? Yes. That's the slate that comes on, I think, over the next 1.5 years, next 1.5 years to 2 years. So I don't exactly know the percent that will fall within the context of this year. But we started this initiative about a year ago, and I must say it's actually extraordinary how how great the content is that's being developed in the international territories. Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Going on that same part about international Disney+. Can you talk about what role the sports play, maybe even outside of India? So what are you seeing in Latin America? Does that help close the gap? And in general, how do you consider maybe loss leading with sports versus pulling back on sports and investing in more of your own content? The sports proposition internationally really varies by market. As you know, in Europe, it's not a big component for us, but in Latin America, it actually is. And our -- the way that we've gone to market in each territory, one of the differences between how we go to market in Asia versus how we go to market in Latin America versus how we go to market in Europe is a function of sports. That's a really big piece of it. And where you see like in Latin America where we've got a very big percentage of our consumers that are subscribing to our services because of sports, it's a bigger component to that. Sports for us are -- it's a very important strategic offering because the fandom and the passion is so deep. If you look at India, we're certainly going to try to extend our rights on the IPL. But we're very confident that even if we were not to go ahead and win that auction that we would still be able to achieve our 230 to 260. So it's an important component for us around the world. Obviously really important in India, but not critical to us achieving the 230 to 260 number that we've guided to. Our next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. So Bob, if I could just follow up on that comment on IPL. Hotstar was about 40% of your long-term guide and without cricket, getting to that number seems like a little bit tougher to do, just given the popularity of the sport in the country and also the fact that Hotstar has been in the country for", "doc_id": "25e869f2-c850-4761-846a-be99adc93b08", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "78ebf02562b1c3811970ae43f84ac141c1a7765c31c9ee6c86ba7d244f3ee7ac", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 322235, "end": 326594, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96714939-cfe7-4621-b6aa-94fae9289ebf", "2": "3302c407-96dc-418f-a929-b2cc3651cdba", "3": "1aad390c-c5e9-44a7-9c48-173b6a75b3f0"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "1aad390c-c5e9-44a7-9c48-173b6a75b3f0": {"__data__": {"text": "of the sport in the country and also the fact that Hotstar has been in the country for a long time as a localized service. So just wanted to see what bridges that gap to your guidance if -- in the scenario that you don't end up getting Hotstar? And then beyond that, maybe -- sorry, go ahead, Bob. . No, no, go ahead, please. So Christine, from a guidance perspective, I guess the other variable is just a breakeven guidance in 2024 for the streaming service. And you did talk about content spend being at least $8 billion to $9 billion in that year last quarter. So just given the growth in entertainment content locally around the world as well as some of the investments in sports in Latin America and potentially an increase in cost in India, could you just frame what kind of upside we could see to that content spend budget? Any framework in terms of how to think about it would be useful. Bob, do you want to start off on the IPL and Christine can chime in with some more detail on that and the breakeven guidance in content spend? Sure, sure. So while the IPL obviously, is an important part of the Disney+ Hotstar content offering, it's really one component of a broader portfolio of entertainment and sports. In addition to, obviously, the original content and the library content from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and Nat Geo, our Disney+ Hotstar offering does have a massive collection of local content, and we add over 18,000 hours of original programming every year. So while certainly it's an important component, that local content that we're developing really will mitigate the impact of us if we were not to win the auction on IPL. So an important component, but it's not like we see that business evaporating if we don't get it. Christine? Okay. Kannan, on your question on the breakeven guidance and on Disney+ content spend. We're not updating the guidance. We have that fiscal '24 guidance out in the marketplace, and we're sticking to it. We're not yet at a steady state of content expense for Disney+, but we expect to have made significant progress by fiscal 2023. Next question comes from Jessica Reif Erlich with Bank of America Securities. Maybe switching gears to Theme Parks. The leverage in that business is ginormous as we've seen in this quarter. Would you consider the 34% operating income margin peak margin? And then just maybe some color because international visitors really haven't come back, we know they stay longer and spend more. Have you gotten all of the technology improvements that you expect? And within that, with some of the changes that you made in the park, it sounds like you're actually improving capacity. So how should we think about capacity now versus what it was prior to COVID? Christine, do you want that one on the margins? Sure. I would say we've been saying this all along through the pandemic, where we have taken measures to really look at the cost base and how we're doing things. And there's been a fundamental shift in some of the operational processes that the parks had used for many, many years and things like the ability to do mobile dining or not having to check in with the human being at a hotel, those kinds of things are all things that add to upside that we have at the parks. And as you mentioned, Jessica, we haven't yet seen the return of our international guests. And remember, historically, and we always hit this historical boundary of our band of 18% to 22% of our Walt Disney World guests came from outside of the U.S., and they haven\u2019t even yet started to return.  So I think there's a lot of things that are boding well, and we saw the performance this quarter of Genie and at the other things like Lightning Lane, but it's not just that. It's also really compelling offerings in food, beverage, merchandise. And it's really great to see not only creativity in our content business, but creativity at our parks as well. And that's driving some of that incremental spending that's certainly helping the margins get to that level that we've seen this quarter. All right. Thanks for the question, Jessica. The next question comes from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.

I believe we're going to be coming up on an anniversary of the first price change that you had for the Disney+ service. And so I was hoping you could give us some insight in terms of how you're thinking about pricing strategy for the product going forward? And what are the key things that influence that in terms of timing, when you bring new content on, distribution partners or anything else we should be thinking about as we model out ARPU? Christine, I'll start with this. And if you want to augment, please do. We maintain that we offer an extraordinary price value relationship around the world for Disney+. Obviously, the last few years, pretty much the entirety of the launch of Disney+ have been plagued by COVID-related production interruptions. Plus in all fairness, our own recognition that we needed to essentially double our production output. You put those 2 things together, and we certainly have less content than we want.
